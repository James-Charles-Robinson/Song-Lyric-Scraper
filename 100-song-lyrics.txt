Nothing it so good it lasts eternally.
Perfect situations must go wrong.
But this has never yet prevented me,
Wanting far too much for far too long.

Looking back, I could have played it differently,
Learned about the man before I fell,
But it took time to understand the man,
Now at least I know I know him well.

Wasn't it good
(Oh so good)
Wasn't it fine
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine.
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
(More security)
He needs his fantasies and freedom
I know him so well.

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side,
And though I move my world to be with him,
Still the gap between him is too much.

Looking back I could have played it differently,
One or a few more who can tell,
But I was ever so much younger then,
Now at least I know I know him well.

Wasn't it good
(Oh so good)
Wasn't it fine
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine.

Didn't I know,
How it would go from the start If I knew,
Why am I falling apart.

Wasn't it good
Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness,
He can't be mine.
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me.
(More security)
He needs his fantasies and freedom.
I know him so well.

It took time to understand him.
I know him so wellGet up
And get your grandma outta here
Pick up
Old Jim is workin' hard this year
And baby
Do the things he says to do

Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuce

Honey
Don't put your man behind his years
And baby
Stop cryin' all your tears
Baby
Do the things he says to do
Do it

Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuce

And baby, if you're feeling good
Yes baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
YeahIf the sun is to set
To leave us dark with regret
I will work up the strength
To pull our earth back round again
And if the ocean should freeze
Before we've sailed all the seas
I will drop to my knees
Until Poseidon agrees

[Repeat x2]
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night

If you get scared of the space
Between now and those days
Then I will take you away
Somewhere fear has no place
We'd make ashes of our clothes
And grow a garden out of those
And watch the water as it rose
To bring the ocean to our toes

[Repeat x2]
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night

It's true
Distance just makes my heart grow for you
And everything I want for us to do
To build an island between me and you
Build an island between me and you

We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
And we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep

[Repeat x2]
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night

We could build an island
We could ride the tides
Oh, we could build an island

[Chorus]
Jasmin my favorite girl my favorite girl in the whole wide world 
won't ever forget the day that 
She stole my heart away now 
Jasmin my favorite girl my favorite girl in the whole wide world 
Want everybody to know that 
She's my favorite girl 

Started out on a friday afternoon 
Came to see a show after school 
And as I rocked the crowd 
Something made me look at you 

And ever since that day 
Since you stole my heart away 
I completely changed I rearranged 
My life is not the same 
I don't know if I will ever see your face again Jasmin 

[Chorus] 

It's been 27 days 
Since you stole my heart away 
And I don't know if we will ever meet once again 
I tried to look you up through friends 

All I got to was dead ends 
I wonder where you live, where you hang out , and where you go 
I don't know if I will ever be the same again Jasmin 

[Chorus]

Fair skin, smooth skin she lives as a legend 
I love the way she licks her lips 
And moves her hips 
Baby got flashed when you do back flips 

When I'm down she listens and pays attention, 
Fills my heart with warmth and affection 
Her smile changes my whole world 
Yo Jasmin don't you know you're my favorite girl 

People tell me I've lost my mind 
So crazy, crazy 'bout you 
God i know I'm a fool for you 
I just can't help myself(x2)

We have no feelings, we feel no pain!

I am numb to all I see,
This the way it has to be,
Gone is hope, gone is need,
I know! stone don't bleed.

What's it worth? if I die.
What's the reason? they all cry.
I have no feelings, too much the same,
Not my problem, I feel no blame.

We are blind and we are cold,

Never said you had to stick around to be with me

I ain't going to be responsible
When your life don't end up full
All your talk has become bull
Just what do you see
Don't place the blame on me

A lack of vision when you made your decision
And you wonder why your life has turned out this way
You tried to use me and succeeded to confuse me
But now you're feeling sorry 'cause you got played

I ain't going to be responsible
When your life don't end up full
All your talk has become bull
Just what do you see
Don't place the blame on me

Life is evil when you don't get what you want
Memories can serve as ghosts
They'll tease and haunt you
When you spend your nights up late
Wondering all about your fate
Why did life end up this way
For youE eu que andava nessa escuridão, 
De repente foi me acontecer.
Me roubou o sono e a solidão, 
Me mostrou o que eu temia ver. 
Sem pedir licença nem perdão, 
Veio louca pra me enlouquecer. 

Vou dormir querendo despertar, 
Pra depois de novo conviver 
Com essa luz que veio me habitar, 
Com esse fogo que me faz arder. 
Me dá medo e vem me encorajar, 
Fatalmente me fará sofrer. 

Ando escravo da alegria. 
Hoje em dia, minha gente, 
Isso não é normal. 
Se o amor é fantasia, 
Eu me encontro ultimamente 
Em pleno carnaval.Everybody plays a game, 
We don't have to save a name, 
Every day come sun array, 
I say good's just playing for safe. 
I don't have to say no more, 
You've got more time waiting for, 
Don't care if I break the law, 
I want more and more and more. 
Everybody plays a game, 
Voice inscription play for safe, 
You've got more time waiting for, 
I want more and more and more and more 
And more and more and more and more 
And more and more and more and more 
And more and more and more and more 
And more and more and more and more 
And.Now westlin winds and slaughtering guns
Bring autumn's pleasant weather
The moorcock springs on whirring wings
Among the blooming heather
Now waving grain, wild o'er the plain
Delights the weary farmer
And the moon shines bright as I rove at night
To muse upon my charmer

The partridge loves the fruitful fells
The plover loves the mountain
The woodcock haunts the lonely dells
The soaring hern the fountain
Through lofty groves the cushat roves
The path of man to shun it
The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush
The spreading thorn the linnet

Thus every kind their pleasure find
The savage and the tender
Some social join and leagues combine
Some solitary wander
Avaunt! Away! the cruel sway,
Tyrannic man's dominion
The sportsman's joy, the murdering cry
The fluttering, gory pinion

But Peggy dear the evening's clear
Thick flies the skimming swallow
The sky is blue, the fields in view 
All fading green and yellow
Come let us stray our gladsome way
And view the charms of nature
The rustling corn, the fruited thorn
And every happy creature

We'll gently walk and sweetly talk
Till the silent moon shines clearly
I'll grasp thy waist and, fondly pressed,
Swear how I love thee dearly
Not vernal showers to budding flowers
Not autumn to the farmer
So dear can be as thou to me
My fair, my lovely charmerWon't you come along with me
To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems,
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-sirree
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues

Basin Street, oh Basin Street
Is the street, mama

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
EverywhereJust yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Convince myself
That I'm better off without you.

Yeah, it's perfectly clear
That love's not what you need
I tell you I don't care

Anything that you say
I hear myself agree
And I don't recognize
What I've turned into,

I could sleep by myself
I would burn me alive
Find me somebody else

But I can rationalize it
If I have to

For a native, for a native New YorkerAmazi-ing Grace, how-ow sweet the-e sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
I-I was blind, but now, I see

T'was Grace that taught my-why heart to fear
And Grace, my fears re-e-elieved
How precious did tha-at Grace appear
Oh-oh the hour I first be-elieved

When we've, when we've been there
Lord, ten thou-ousand year-ears
Bright shining, bright shining as the su-un
We've no le-ess days to sing Go-od's praise
Then when, we first be-egun

We've no less days to sing Go-od's praise
Then when we first begunI pray for the love
That`s fallen from grace
The tears left behind
Won`t wash from my face

I`m left with all these feelings
But nothing fills the space
Of the love that once was
That`s fallen from grace

Every little picture
Hanging on the wall
Every little trace of you
I`ve found them all

I close my eyes
It`s all I can do
Everywhere I look
I see some part of you

Been through every reason
And they all seem to fit
No one`s pleaded guilty now
There`s nothing to admit

There`s no one to blame baby

'Cause people only touch and go
But love will never leave

I`m a little disappointed
I`m a little bit relieved
I feel a little sorry baby
I feel a bit deceived

No no not by you darlin`
I know love`s demanding
Live and learning every day
But never understanding

Shattered dream and memories of you
Left hanging over me
A cross to bear
When love cools

A crown of thorns
For the queen of fools

Of the love that once was
That`s fallen from graceIt started out in innocence 
the way that most things do 
a thousand people crammed in one place 
but the only face was you 
I grabbed your hand and we raced out 
hardly said a word 
I'd only seen you for a minute 
but I was round in third 
and we traded on our backgrounds 
you mentioned I seemed shy 
then you laughed 
and said I'm an uptown, uptempo woman 
You're a downtown, downbeat guy 

Within a week I'd moved in, 
at your uptown, east side place 
we'd make love for hours on a bed of silk and lace 
and she would get up early 
and come home late at night 
she'd have important busainess 
but my prospects all seemed slight 
tired on some evenings 
she'd get mad and cry 
I'm an uptown, uptempo woman 
You're a downtown, downbeat guy 

The romance soon was over 
and the lust was getting thin 
I soon began to relalise 
the mess I'd gotten in 
but as always happens 
you're caught in such a trap 
you get so used to what's around 
you cant find your way back 
so I lived with this arrangement 
and soon learned to despise 
the uptown, uptempo woman 
and the downtown, downbeat guy 

And then one Saturday in March 
I decided I would go 
as I was going nowhere 
and my mind was getting slow 
I opened all the closets 
there wasnt much to pack 
I felt bad not telling her 
that I wasnt coming back 
but this day she was early 
she looked at me and asked why 
I said why 

You're an uptown, uptempo woman 
I'm a downtown, downbeat guySpring still paints fire escapes with Hopper shades
Radio's rap and screech like trains
A figure's floating through the sewing set
Some guy walks by suspended by the sky

Takes more imagination
When every thing's remote control
For me it's just a case of what's on the other side of clothes

Tell everybody I'm gone away for ten years
I'm gone to wander among the Wicklow Hills

New Jersey white kid in his sunday jeans
Stuck to the corner of the street
Fat gypsy lady smacks the window pane
Some guy walks by suspended by the sky

Takes more imagination
When every thing's remote control
For me it's just a case of what's on the other side of clothes

Tell everybody I'm gone away for ten years
I'm gone to wander among the Wicklow HillsIn this world, if you read the papers, darling
You know everybody's fighting ah with each other
You got no one you can count on babe
Not even your own brother
So if someone comes along
He gonna give you some love and affection

I'd say get it while you can, yeah
Honey, get it while you can, yeah
Hey hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love, no, no

Don't you know when you're loving anybody, baby
You're taking a gamble on a little sorrow
But then who cares, baby
'Cause we may not be here tomorrow, no

And if anybody should come along
He gonna give you any love and affection
I'd say get it while you can, yeah
Hey, hey, get it while you can
Hey, hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love
No no no, no no no no no

Oh, get it while you can, yeh
Honey get it when you're gonna wanna need it dear, yeah yeah
Hey hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love
No no no, no no no no, get it while you can

I said hold on to somebody when you get a little lonely, dear
Hey hey, hold on to that man's heart
Hey hey, get it, want it, hold it, need it
Get it, want it, need it, hold it
Get it while you can, yeah
Honey get it while you can, baby, yeah
Hey hey, get it while you canThe train is comin' at six -oh - five
And I'll be gettin' on it to take a long ride
Back to an apartment so empty inside
With loneliness the only thing that's waiting

I bought my ticket today
I just paid for one way
The price was too high for returning

I have spent all my love
Getting none in return
I bought a ticket to nowhere today

And I still hear her voice
As it rings in my brain
Telling me she's in love
Oh, yes, well, really

That she's been hurt before
That's what first love is for
But now she's found the kind of love
That she's been needing

She's standing there so shy
Feeling nothing inside
Not seeing the pain my eyes are trying to hide
For her, it was fun, but it's all said and done
No love left in the silence of goodbye

And I still hear her voice
As it rings in my brain
Telling me she's in love
Oh, yes, well, really

That she's been hurt before
That's what first love is for
But now she's found the kind of love
That she's been needing

I bought a ticket to nowhere today
I bought a ticket to nowhere today
I bought a ticket to nowhere today
I bought a ticket to nowhere today
I bought a ticket to nowhere todayJust an ordinary day
Till you came around
I had my feet on the ground
So much for that

Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
And now my life's upside down
Imagine that

And it's all because I heard you say
And it's all because I heard you say
And it's all because I walked your way

Oh just right
You got to sit tight
Close your eyes
And let your head go down
Let your feet up off the ground
And let your head go down
Let your feet up off the ground

Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
I had my head straight and sound
They've told me that

Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
And now my life is on the bounce
Just like that

And it's all because I walked your way
And it's all because I heard you say
And I should've known to stay away

Right out of my mind
I'm leavin' my cares
And worries behind

'Cause I'm on my way
I'm leavin' town today
My lonesome old heart
Is broken into

I've been walkin' the floor
Every night over you
But our love is all gone
I'm movin' on

I'm a-leavin' town today
I got no love, no cares
Just heartaches
I'm leavin' them all behind

Like the sun and the moon
And the stars above
We're gonna be one of a kind
Well, I'm movin' along

I gotta be free
I'll find a new love
Wherever I'll be
But my old love is gone

I'm movin' on
I'm a-leavin' town today
I got no love, no cares
No heartaches

Like the sun, and the moon
And the stars above
We're gonna be one of a kind

I'll find a new love
Wherever I'll be

But my old love is gone
I'm movin' on
I'm a-leavin' town today
I'm leavin' this town todayWhat did I say to you, what did you see me do
That made ya turn to stone overnight
I thought I played it right
Lovin' you deep in the night
The chain of love is broken now
Why can't we start again
'Cause my heart won't mend
But you say no, then you go, and I break down

I'm still a lonely man burning in love
I'm still a lonely man burning in love

What did he say to you
What did he promise you
That made you change from white to black
I don't understand it
It seems so underhanded
I want to hate you but I'm still in love
Why can't we start again,
'Cause my heart won't mend
But you say no, then you go
And I break down

I'm still a lonely man burning in love
I'm still a lonely man burning in love

Why can't we start again
'Cause my heart won't mend
But you say no, then you go
And I break down

I'm still a lonely man burning in love
I'm still a lonely man burning in love

I'm still a lonely man burning in love
I'm still a lonely man burning in love

Burning in love
Burning, burning in love
Burning in love
Burning in loveLori Meyers used to live upstairs
Our parents had been friends for years
Almost every afternoon we'd play forbidden games
At nine years old there's no such thing as shame

It wasn't recognition of her face, what
Brought me back was a familiar mark
As it flashed across the screen. I
Bought some magazines, some video taped scenes
Incriminating act I felt that I could save her

Who the hell are you to tell me how to live my life?
You think I sell my body; I merely sell my time
I ain't no Cinderella, I ain't waiting for no prince
To save me in fact until just now I was doin' just fine
And on and on

I know what degradation feels like
I felt it on the floor of the factory
Where I worked long before, I took control
Now I answer to me
The 50K I make this year will go anywhere I please
Where's the problem?Here am I, alone in your sky
With my mind passing by the thoughts in your eye
If I were you, and you were me,
Could you feel how unreal your world seems to be? 

Oh please, don't mind that I'm here
For who am I when you're near?
I'll try to find a place in my mind
Where you know you can go, and leave all behind

How does it feel when a dream seems so real
And you fly through my eye on a steel rainbow wheel?
Searching my mind for thoughts left behind
Let you feel you're concealed by a smile-coloured blind

Oh please, don't mind that I'm here
For who am I when you're near?
I'll try to find a place in my mind
Where you know you can go, and leave all behindTook the high dive into your brain
And you made your lonely calls
You just might wear your welcome out
If you don't let it go

There's nothing that you couldn't say
'Cause you've said it all before
I think it's time you walked this lonely road
All on your own

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

I wish I could take it away
And save you from yourself
You get so lost inside your head 
like no one else

Looking for someone to blame?
Did you blame me all along?
You'll take the heat
But you would never take the fall

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

You're so afraid that you are the only one
that you are the only one
You know
Don't be afraid because you're not the only one
You're not the only one
I know

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already wonI'm glad you're home
Now did you really miss me?
I guess you did by the look in your eye (look in your eye, look in your eye)
Well, lay back and relax
While I put away the dishes (put away the dishes)
Then you and me can rock a bell

You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell

The night is young
And full of possibilities
Well, come on and let yourself be free, yeah

So long I've been savin'
Tonight was made for me and you

Another footstep where I once walked. (Take my hand)
Take it all.

You take my hand and give me your friendship.
I'll take my time and send you my slow reply.
Give me an inch and I'll make the best of it.

A footprint haunts an empty floor. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)
A fading coat that I once wore. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)

'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place
No reply
No replyYou ain't been blue, no, no, no
You ain't been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh, "Go 'long blues"

Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evenin' when lights are low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just as blue as blue could be
Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye

Blues on my mind
Blues all around my head, ooo ooo
Blues on my mind
Blues all around my head, oo oo yeah
Woke up this morning
But I'd be better off dead, uh huh

And now they're comin' for to carry me homeSee now I went to the club and I ran into this girl
And she was telling 'bout how she feel and everything
Her name was New York
But she said Troy listen

She said yo new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We've been wantin' something this good for a while
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo face
'Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

She like my style, she like my flows
It ain't no chuck involved, she knows
I came so far from dealin' blow
Been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody sound like this
We ain't the same, they rode that dick
F*ck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips

She got the long hair, ain't nothing fake
Flute glass full of birthday cake
All blue thong with the stars on it
Layin' in my bed and she all on it
Rewind back, before I grind the cat
Two steppin' in the club with my dogs all strapped
There for dough, playin' with the bitches
A flashy young nigga before we took the pictures
I can take ya number, can't be ya man
But you can act like it in ya Instagram
I like flippin' grams and you like me
And if you into getting money baby you like me
Come on, I'm out here, sound the alarm
I heard one good girl is worth a thousand whores
One good song is worth a thousand tours
So before I leave, proceed wit yo boy

She said yo new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We've been wantin' something this good for a while
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo face
'Cause when we danced I felt that fifth all on yo waist

It's that NY sound, oh this that new NY sound
Puttin' it down for the town
I used to put them birds in and out of town
But look at me now

One brick at a time on the road to get mine
Spit about it in rhymes now the hustle combined
Pop I'm killin' these bitches I done stayed on my grind
Motivated by money and puttin' on time
To get busy, these other niggas been iffy
They callin' me young Jay, they call me the new 50
Call me what you want except broke, let's toast
Who the f*ck I'm supposed to sound like, I'm from New York
Troy Ave got the streets in a frenzy though
I bought the spotlight back, you should thank me no
And if you don't, then we know you a hater bro
"A playa hater" Biggie quote
I'm on the radio baby everyday, that's my word
I restored the feeling, I kept up my word
The new sheriff in town, the chuck is over
BSB roll with us so you get rolled over

She said yo new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We've been wantin' something this good for a while
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo face
'Cause when we danced I felt that fifth all on yo waist

SIng sing
Start singing, keep swinging
Now you're singing with a swingLong ago in days untold 
Were ruled by lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold they dared
To bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines 
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws 
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive
Oh I know I 
Lived this life afore
Somehow I know now 
Truths I must be sure
Tossin', turnin', nightmares burnin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships, the Viking spits
The blood of father's land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death, fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die
Screams of no reply
They died
Screams of no reply
And died
Died
Lordy, Lordy, they diedEl Que Busca Encuentra

She'll be there to wave to you.
In the hope that you'll forgive her,
She will join you there...

Find out that now was
the answer to answers,
that you gave later.
She did the things that
we both did before now,
but who forgave her.

Now you see how down you've fallen,
Now you hear your conscious call.
Thank yourself alone for stallin',
I'm not there to call...

Call me a fool cause
I need her, and see her,
but now you're down.
Something inside you
will tell you I'm wise to
what you're spreadin' round.

If I could stand to see her cryin',
I would tell her not to care.
When she learns of all your lyin',
Would she join you there...

Find out that now was
the answer to answers,
that you gave later.I wandered so aimless life filed with sin
I wouldn't let my dear saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the lord I saw the light.

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the lord I saw the light

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that god gave back his sight
Praise the lord I saw the light.

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the lord I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and astray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the lord I saw the light.

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the lord I saw the lightShe laughed in my face, told me good-bye
Said "Don't think about it, you can go crazy
Anything can happen, anything can end
Don't try to fight it, don't try to save me"

[Chorus]
She's a woman in love
And he's gonna break her heart to pieces
She don't want to see
She's a woman in love, but it's not me

Well alright, do what you want
Don't try to talk, don't say nothin'
She used to be the kind of woman
You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
She let the little things go

[Chorus]

Time after time, night after night
She would look up at me
And say she was lonely
I don't understand the world today
I don't understand what she needed
I gave her everything she threw it all away
On nothin'
She's a woman in loveThrough these city nightmares you'd walk with me
And we'd talk of it with idealistic assurance
That it wouldn't tear us apart
We'd keep our heads above the blackened water
But there's no room for ideals in this mechanical place
And you're gone now

Through a grimy window that I can't keep clean
Through billowing smoke that's swallowed the sun
You're nowhere to be seen

Do you think our desires still burn
I guess it was desires that tore us apart
There has to be passion
A passion for living, surviving
And that means detachment
Every-body has a weapon to fight you with
To beat you with when you are down
There were too many defence between us
Doubting all the time
Fearinf all the time
Doubting all the time
Fearinf all the time
That like these urban nightmares
We'd blacken each other skies

When we passed the subway we tried to ignore our fate there
Of written threats on endless walls
Unjustified crimes carried on stifled calls
Would you walk with me now through this pouring rain
It used to mingle with our tears then dry with the hopes
That we left behind
It rains even harder now .Through these city nightmares you'd walk with me
And we'd talk of it with idealistic assurance
That it wouldn't tear us apart

It rains even harder now .Anything we should know about your change? 
It doesn't have to be pretty
It doesn't have to move the crowd
In no particular city
Just a clearing with little else around
It doesn't have to look steady
Don't really care on which side of town
I've been rocked and now I'm ready
I am only trying to get this thing down
I am only trying to get this thing down

It's more a holdout than a bust
Head to your knees and soldier up
It's too little and too much at once
I don't think they're water landing us
And one set of wings just will not be enough

It shouldn't have to be a scandal
It's not a missile you're trying to stop
I have been shook had more than a few shots
Been hooked longer than not
Don't be secret to me now
Are you roses or burial ground
I have been lost and I'm ready to be found
I am only trying to get this thing down
I am only trying to get this thing down

It's more a holdout than a bust
Head to your knees and soldier up
It's too little and too much at once
I don't think they're water landing us
And one set of wings just will not be enough

From where you are it must seem crazy
This weaving in and out of clouds
It's not an airstrike believe me
I am only trying to get this thing down
I am only trying to get this thing down

It's a more a holdout than a bust
Head to your knees and soldier up
It's too little and too much at once
I don't think they're water landing us
And one set of wings just will not be enoughSur l'oreiller une larme

I was wanting more
But you were f*cking that girl next door
What'd you do that for? (what'd you do that for?)

When you first left me
I didn't know what to say
I'd never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me
You say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack
No, it don't mean jack

I couldn't stop laughing
No, I just couldn't help myself
See, you messed up my mental health
I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
It's only because you're feeling alone

Niggas laying down on the ground,
It's a showdown.
Don't you come around trying to clown,
It's a showdown.
Niggas laying down on the ground,
It's a showdown.
Don't you come around trying to clown,
It's a showdown.

Listen up all you damned dare varmints
It's finna be a showdown.
Better flee the scene 
That's on the real,
Better keep that head down.
Pick a bigger strap, better come equip
And don't trip cause I'm bout to let it loose.
Pullin' out a pocket knife
Will get you snyped
And you know niggas is gonna have to shoot.
Could it be that I had the loot 
In a mood for bustin' chickens
Nigga thought he had him a sweet vic
But he had him a schizophrenic.
Better have that itchy for the homicide
Ain't no love, I'ma let it ride
Now it's gonna be a showdown.
On the lowdown,
Better stay inside
Trippin' cause a nigga gonna die
If Billy Joe didn't tell that lie
He would still be in the barn.
Instead, he got buckshots in his right side.
Ms. Hay she cooked as punkin pie.
Gettin' high in the f*ckin' barn
The showdown it was all good,
And I came home with that smokey gun.

[Chorus]

Wait a minute,
Hold up now,
Who want confrontation.
Punk ass nigga, you run with a clique,
Ha, I ride with a nation.
And I'm bustin',
Not to mention I'm cappin' every nigga
On your deck, so don't sleep
To make you stifle.
Got a rifle with a scope,
You can't cope when the Conflict's on the creep.
You came to closed to the style partner
Can't f*ck with the rodeo.
Here we go, wild westside,
Gitty up, move em out,
Head for the hills
I'ma let it ride.
The trick didn't know about the gangbang boogie
'til it fell on the floor wit a ass full of lead.
No need for calling out your momma name now
Son-of-a-bitch you dead.
On your mark,
Get ready,
Set trip,
I'm comin' wit a nine millimeter motherf*cker
Block bam,
My shit never jam.
Like a hoe you fold
When I stuck you snipin
Off a building
Gangbangin' is an everyday thing.
Runnin' down on a hoe down,
Gotta low down,
It's a showdown,
Nigga bout to go down,
Slow down!

[Chorus]

I'm just a bogus nigga
F*ck that nigga next to me.
You get that ass dropped quick
Never had no love
Now you want to challenge me.
F*ck yo chief
We got some beef.
When I die, it's gonna be a gang fight
I'ma be the nigga that take your life
Pop your ass 
Say nighty-night.
Born to do some damage
I'll be damned if I let a motherf*cker 
Even think he rough.
Blaze that bitch 
And bust him up.
Pussy motherf*cker I'ma take your stuff.
Shit is out of pocket man,
But all this shit is finna change,
Cause when I come this time
I'ma show you a nine ain't no joke,
I'ma kill you some more,
And show them fools wild style ain't no hoe.
And if I die we all gotta go
Bad thing about it,
I don't give a f*ck,
Wondering what I'm livin' for
Face to face with a nigga that I hate.
I'ma meet you on the hell ground,
Look you up in your eyes and spray,
Smoke you in the showdown.

[Chorus]

A motherf*cker told me it was gonna be a showdown.
When I came around I was up for breakin' motherf*ckers down.
F*ck it niggas wit it
Let's rock the town,
Flee on the scene,
Now what's up baby.
Car full of niggas straight lookin' shady
Came to loot
Better have what you gone shoot,
'Cause we straight actin' crazy.
C-O-N Flict nigga
That's what it is when you tote them triggers
Gangbangalistic father figure.
Daddy to the niggas that think they sucker,
Yeah.
It's a showdown,
Not just my hood, but town from town
Making motherf*ckers recognize the flavor
Coming from Chi-Town.
Yee-Haw!
Be quick to draw 
Pick a nigga meat up out with a chainsaw.
Make a nigga see what he never saw.
Crucial Conflict comin' at you raw
For a showdown,
We don't play around.
Motherf*ckers gone die
We gone kill 'em up pal.
Motherf*ckers playing these damn games,
Kill 'em up in the showdown.

[Chorus]We wander from the grave
With grey and clouded eyes
And death is overcome
As a world of blood is born
There's no love and all I see is hunger
Life fades away from the jaded world
And so they fall before the fallen
Who cannot die, we cannot die away
There is a house that lays
On cemetery lane
And there a life was lived
A life of loss and pain
Dream of nights that faded fast
For the end is drawing near
And the light of day can't save you now
For the fallen have no fear

Girls!That's right my name is Danny Boy and I like to drink at night.
I go down to the pub, wherein I buy myself a pind or three.
I like to go out drinking, 'cause beer it is my life,
Until I come home and lay eyes upon my darling wife.
And they say
Oh Danny, won't you go home earlier tonight?
Your daugher doesn't know you
And your giving us a fright when you say...
Say, something's wrong with anyone who's not lik eme.
With you the violence just comes so easily.
You never learn I have to teach you constantly.
Hush now.
That's right my name is Danny Boy and I'll buy another round.
Then off to the marked when this place closes down.
I say drinking's always done when the sun's up in the sky.
The sun is always up somwhere,
And it's your turn to buy and they say,
Oh, Danny, won't you go home earlier tonight?
Your son he doesn't know you and your giving us a fright when you say
Say, somthing's wrong with anyone who's not like me.
With you the violence just comes so easily.
You never learn I have to teach you constantly.
Hush now.
Hush now.
Sleep.
Sleep floating child.
..This is affectionate.
There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to in our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever from the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty but it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
Now you rush right through me and I start to drown

And there's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret that gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And that's the edge of sanity, I've never been this close
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost

Unknowing captor, you never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free?
I'm forever under lock and key as you pass through me

Now I see your face before me, I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free, the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch, I am no worse than most
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghostYou'd look nice in a grave
I smile at the moon, death is on my face
And if you wait too long
Then you'll never see the dawn again

My skull is full of sunken ships
My heart's a prisoner to my ribs
We're flesh and bone when we're all alone
But together, forever, we'll live

There's gold in my heart
But the winds took my sails through the dark
And if you wait too long
then you'll never see the dawn again

He filled my heart, I did my best
But without the sun, I'm only shadows in a dress
'Cause if the full moon comes, our love is done
So forever, towards dawn, we runYou'd look nice in a grave
I smile at the moon, death is on my face
And if you wait too long

He filled my heart, I did my best
But without the sun, I'm only shadows in a dress
'Cause if the full moon comes, our love is done
So forever, towards dawn, we runAs I walk along, I wonder
A what went wrong whit our love
A love that was so strong

And as I still walk on
I think of the thing's we've done
Together, while our hearts were young

I'm a walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel a pain
A wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery

And I wonder, I wa wa wa wa wonder
Why a why why why why why
She ran away
And I wonder where she will stay
My little runaway
My run run run run runaway

I love it when you play it like that
Come on... Play

Sittin' here alone I'm lookin' back on where I've roamed
And laughing how I swore I'd win and not get burned
Left my family
Left my home
I worked my fingers to the bone
And there was not a stone I did not leave unturned
And I was havin' a good time

Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster
We're one day older and one step closer
Roll on there's mountains to climb
Roll on we're on borrowed time
Roll on Roller coaster
Roll on tonight
Roll on tonight yeah

Money and success
I don't complain about the stress
I wanted this and now it's here
So I don't bitch
And I swear that time's a trick
It disappears in oh so quick
Man I was just sixteen
And now I'm starin' at thirty-six
But I'm still havin' a good time

Roll on Roll on Roller Coaster

And I know it's hard to see with the sun in your eyes
But one day you're gonna say I saw the light

And now headin' for the hill
And I just cannot wait until
My children grow up to have children of their own
And I'll be telling them about
The times I turned the party out
And how I stood against an army all alone
Drinkin' wine and stayin' high
And realized it couldn't last
And how I turned myself around
And went down another path
And the signs we must observe
When life's changes do occur
But most of all I'll tell them
Just how proud I am of them
And always have a good time
It's all love and good times
Let's all have a good time Yeah

I wear 'cause you told me
That you dig that crazy hue

Do we feel the romance
When we go to the dance
Oh no, you take a glance
At those shiny stockings

Then came along some chick
With great big stockings, too
When you changed your mind about me
Why, I never knew

I guess I'll have to find
A new, a new kind

Now life is sweet and what it brings
I tried to take
The loneliness it wears me out
It lies in wait
And on a loss still in my eyes
Shatter a necklace across your thigh
I might've lived my life in a dream
But I swear this is real
Memory fuses, and shatters like glass

The scientist talks and he knows what he means
He sits on the floor and has beautiful dreams
Then he gets brought down by a woman who screams
But he knows it`s only a record¡­ Oh yes it is

His brave new girl stops feeding the ants
And looks at him with her septic pants
She still knows how to make him dance
And forget about emancipation¡­ it`s just imagination

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their f*ckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
or we'll start the wettin up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
Big Shug, Guru, Freddie Foxxx, The Militia, militia

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the f*ck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and f*ck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, "Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!"
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherf*ckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools
It's the Militia
Then the rainstorm came, over me
And I felt my spirit break
I had lost all of my, belief you see
And realized my mistake
But time through a prayer, to me
And all around me became still

I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me now I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need to help me know my name

Don't bend, don't break
Show me how to live and promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love will help me know my name

Through the rainstorm came sanctuary
And I felt my spirit fly
And I had found all of my reality
I realize what it takes
'Cause I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me now I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need to help me know my name

Oh I, don't bet, don't break
Show me how to live and promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love will help me know my name

Now I try to say there's nothing wrong
When inside I felt me lying all along
But the message here was plain to see
Believe me

Oh I, don't bet, don't break
Show me how to live and promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love will help me know my name
I said that love will help me know my name, my name, my nameElla me miro

Night sky hangs
Around to greet her

Lifeline of kisses
Anchored to the ground
Balloon descending

These are the hands that can't help reaching for you
If you're anywhere inside (anywhere inside)

Girl, so show me, and tell me
That you feel the same way tooHey, fellows have you heard the news,
The women in this town are being misused,
Seen it all in a dream last night,
You'll be leaving this town 'cause you don't feel right,
Cause I'm leaving, leaving here
Hey fellows, better change your ways,
Or they'll be leaving this town in a matter of days,
They all say, and everything's so true,
We fellows run around with someone new,
Cause I'm leaving, leaving here,

Yeah, one by one, yeah two by two,
Yeah three by three, yeah four by four

Hey fellows, better change your ways,
Or they'll be leaving this town in a matter of days,
One day, one day and it won't be long,
And all them fine chicks will be gone,
Cause I'm leaving, leaving here,

Yeah two by two, yeah four by four,
Oh yeah, I'm leaving hereWhen I was small, and Christmas trees were tall
We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Someone else moved in from far away

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall
Do do do do do do do do do
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Someone else moved in from far awayYou don't dress up in satin,
You don't wear diamond rings,
But I'm satisfied with you.
You look just like an angel but you haven't got wings,
But I'm satisfied with you.

I'd rather have you just the way that you are
Than change you for somebody new.
Maybe I could do better if I reached for a star,
But I'm satisfied with you.

You're not made out of candy
But you're as sweet as you can be
So I'm satisfied with you.
I just can't see no reason why you bother with me,
But I'm satisfied with you.

I often wonder if it's all a mistake
It's hard to believe that it's true.
But If I'm only dreaming, I sure don't want to wake,
'Cause I'm satisfied with you.
I'm satisfied with you.When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for youYou said only a back page
Will get as read as the first page
Now you're observing the corners
Are showing the first signs of aging
I'm not trying to read you anymore
Just keep on turning me through the days
Until the latest chapter unfolds

You look aroused, you look awake
You are the light turned on

A slumber will fall on you again
But in your dreams you're being held
Underneath the elephants in the room
You were trampled stampeded down

Broken all our hearts
You've broken all our hearts
But they no longer ache now
They don't hurt

You look aroused
You look awake
You are the light turned on

You look aroused
You look awake
You are the light turned on

You look aroused
You look awake
You are the light turned on

You look aroused
You look awake
You are the light turned onC'est pas que je n'aime pas les gens
Mais je suis comme, à l'étroit dans leur monde
C'est pas que je n'ai pas le temps
Mais dans mon cur, j'y peux rien, le tonnerre gronde

C'est pas que je n'aime pas ma femme
Mais j'en peux plus d'entendre «Je suis pas trop grosse?» 
Non
C'est pas que je n'aime pas mon job
Mais j'en peux plus d'être au service de mon boss
Je rêve de lui dire vous êtes aussi con que moche

Donc y a des jours où je me lâche et j'envoie tout foutre en l'air
Ouais je veux que l'on me lâche, j'ai besoin de prendre l'air

C'est pas que je n'aime pas mes vieux
Si je les écoute, je finirai dans les rangs
C'est pas que je n'aime pas mes potes
mais si je les suis, je finirai dans le vent
A courir après la gloire, les femmes et l'argent

Donc y a des jours où je me lâche et j'envoie tout foutre en l'air
Ouais je veux que l'on me lâche, j'ai besoin de prendre l'air
Y a des jours où je me lâche et j'envoie tout foutre en l'air
Ouais je veux que l'on me lâche, j'ai besoin de prendre l'air

Je me fous de ce que l'on peut dire dans mon dos
La rumeur ou bien le qu'en dira-t-on 
pendant que le monde dérive moi je quitte le bateau
je lâche prise avant de péter les plombs

Alors y a des jours où je me lâche et j'envoie tout foutre en l'air
Ouais je veux que l'on me lâche, j'ai besoin de prendre l'air
Je me lâche et j'envoie tout foutre en l'air
Alors je trace sans de voir tout foutre en l'air
Je me lâche, j'ai besoin de prendre l'air
Et je me lâche, et j'envoie tout foutre en l'air
Alors je trace, j'ai besoin de prendre l'air
Je me lâche, j'ai besoin de prendre l'air (j'ai besoin de prendre l'air)
Avant de tout foutre en l'airEsta vida que yo tengo
És muy bonita, és muy bonita
Pa' que no se me acabara
Fuera bendita, fuera bendita
Pa' poder vivir cerquita
De las cosas que mas quiero
Que no me pusiera viejo
Pa' estar siempre jovencito
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

A la edad de quince años
Ya yo cantaba, ya yo cantaba
Y a los veintidós cumplidos
Ya yo grababa, ya yo grababa
Ya la gente comenzaba
A valorizar mi canto
Y al lado del gran Colacho
Me llené de requisitos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

He vivido todo el tiempo
Enamorado de una morena
La que meritoriamente
Hizo que fuera yo el dueño de ella
La pobre ha salio tan buena
Pero casi vive sola
Porque salgo a toda hora
A cumplir mis compromisos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

Vivo muy agradecido
De aquella gente que me acompaña
A donde quiera que voy
Cada dia mas dandome fama
Yo no sé cómo se paga
Ese gesto tan bonito
Quiero repartir mi alma
Dandole a todo' un poquito
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitosYou were talking and I thought I heard you say
"Please leave me alone.
Nothing in this world can make me stay.
I'd rather go back, I'd rather go back home."

But if you believed in me like I believe in you,
We could have a love so true, we would go on endlessly.

[Chorus]
And I know anyday, anyday, I will see you smile.
Any way, any way, only for a little while.

Well someday baby, I know you're gonna need me
When this old world has got you down.
I'll be right here, so woman call me
And I'll never ever let you down.

[Chorus: x2]

To break the glass and twist the knife into yourself;
You've got to be a fool to understand.
To bring your woman back home after she's left you for another,
You've got to be a, you've got to be a man.

[Chorus: x2]

Anyday, anyday, I will see you smile.
Any way, any way, just for a little, just for a little while.With friends like these
There's no need to worry your head
It seems
They know everything
Hand on the heart
They see how you should feel
But, oh, how
The mighty all fall down
Heavy in a sea of principles
They drown

They have only one dream
Only one way
With only one vision and
Thought for the day

With friends like these
Woh, oh, woh
Cautioning the way the world is turning
I want to know
Will they ever, ever see
Or be sure
There's another way
Your mind is working?

Now right or wrong
They never walk alone
How lucky are the few
Who know where they belong
For they have...

Only one dream
Only one way
With only one vision and
Thought for the day

There is only (there is only)
One dream (yeah, there is only)
Only one way
With only one vision
Thought for the day (here's your thought for the day)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Your thought for the day (here's your thought for the day)
Your thought for the dayYou don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.Never treat me sweet and gentle
The way she should
'Cause I got it bad, and that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
And it's not made of wood
Now, I got it bad and that ain't good

When the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around
I end up like start out
Just crying my heart out

She don't love me like I love her
Nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good

Now when the weekend's over
Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out
Just crying

Oh, she don't love me like I love her
Nobody could
I got it bad and it sure is good[Noreaga]

The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.A scrap of flesh 
And a heap of bones 
One deep high 
And a desperate moan 

Three black eyes 
And a busted nose 
I said oh yeah, oh yeah 

Take me up 
Baby I'm ready to go 
Shake me up 
Baby I'm ready to go, yeah 
Take me up 
Baby I'm ready 
Baby, baby I'm ready to go

I'm not going to burn in hell 
I cased the joint 
And I know it well 
Maybe my carcass 
Would feed the worms 
But I'm working 
For the other firm 

Take me up 
Baby I'm ready to go 
Fix me up 
Baby I'm ready to roll, yeah 
Set me up 
Baby, baby, baby I'm ready to go 
(Chill me, freeze me, It's in my blood) 
Flip the switch 

I got my money, my ticket 
All that shit 
I even got myself 
A little shaving kit 
What would it take 
To bury me 
I can't wait 
I can't wait to see 

I got toothbrush, mouthwash 
All that shit 
I'm looking down 
In the filthy pit 
I had the turkey 
And the stuffing too 
I even saved 
A little bit for you 

Lethal injection is a luxury 
I want to give it 
To the whole jury 
I'm just dying 
For one more squeeze 
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 

Pick me up 
Baby I'm ready to go 
Take me up 
Baby I'm ready to blow 
Take me up 
Baby if you're ready to go 
Baby I got nowhere to go 
Baby I'm ready to go 
(Chill me, freeze me, to my bones) 
Flip the switchOnce I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever partOkay, this guy walks into a bar
No, I'm just, I'm just f*ckin' with you. I'm kiddin'.
Na, there's this, this young bull and this old bull 
And they're standin' on top of a hill.

And I tried to tell you before that that's why I left California.

So they're standin' on top of this hill, right?
And they're looking out over a pasture full of cows.
Whole f*ckin' pasture.
And the young bull turns to the old bull and he goes,
"I got this really good idea."
And the old bull's like, "Yeah?"

And I tried to tell you before that that's why I left California.

"Hey," he's, he's like "Yeah. Yeah I got this really good idea.
Let's run down that hill and f*ck one o' those cows."
And the old bull just looks at him. You know, he's just lookin' at him, 
He's like, "Look, I got a better idea."
The young bull's like, "Oh yeah? What's your f*ckin' brilliant idea?"
And the old bull goes

And I tried to tell you before that that's why I left California.

And the old bull goes, "Let's walk down that hill 
And f*ck all o' those cows. Dig?"
You know like he ain't been in town long or something, I don't know.

And I tried to tell you before that that's why I left California.Pero ven acá, who you wanna be?
Drug Dealer? dime
Rap nigga?
You tryna save the culture?
Ay dios mio
You gotta pick one daddy

Leave your conscious at the door
We done hid the monsters in the floor
I speak to the trap lords
And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards
I done been black balled 
And never gave a f*ck 'cause I'm Jack Frost
Of sellin' that blast off
I'm on a crash course
Where talent meets timing
Christopher Wallace, Think Big, keep climbing
Reasonable doubt, drug era, keep climbing
I'm my brother's keeper, Lord Willin', keep grindin'
As a God amongst men
Rinsed drug money, I done paid for my sins
Books and the lawyers, I done paid for my friends
Still held back, I done paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late, great on me
Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now it's murder was the case homie
I'm watching this three ring circus 
Old lions don't roar, so the clowns ain't nervous
Even you fools serve purpose 
Let 'em run amuck until the king resurface
Then it's off with your heads
Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you're dead
They take samples of 'em, I make examples of 'em
It's the thrill of the hunt, I keep my mantle covered
Ask 'Ye who's loyalty more realer
Ask P, who's core's a drug dealer
Me and Tim, it's coming, it's gonna kill 'em
The only great I ain't made better was J. Dilla
Now we breaking new ground
Get ready for the placing of the crown
King Push nigga!
