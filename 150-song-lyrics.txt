Everyday, every, every dayAcaricia mi sueño
El suave murmullo
De tu suspirar
Como rie la vida
Si tus ojos negros
Me quieren mirar

Y si es mio el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella aquieta mi herida
Todo todo se olvida

El dia que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestira de fiesta
Con su mejor color

Y al viento las campanas
Diran que ya eres mia
Y locas las fontanas
Se juraran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Bajo el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar

Y un rayo misterioso
Hara nido en tu pelo
Luciernaga curiosa
Que vera
Que eres mi consuelo

Twas the blight before christmas
and all through the dawn
the scene was quiet except pop and mom
there sat hung in their big easy chair
goofed on egg nog sherry and beer
ces and lil jr, lie there in the bed
whle visions of cadillacs jumped in their head
moms jumped up and said pops lets quit it to bed
then out on the stoop oweee such a clatter
pops fled to the porthole to see what was the matter
he did a jump and fell back

I was five years old when daddy started packin'
And I stood there by my mamma
As she cried
And the next thing that we knew
Some old train came passin' through
And daddy got on board
And we ain't seen him no more

I wonder why trains make me lonesome
It happens every time that engine moan's some
And when I hear that whistle blow
Why it makes my heart sink low
And I wonder why trains make me lonesome

It was a cold dark night
When I drove her to the depot
There were tears in my eyes
And a ticket in her hand
And as we stood there by those tracks
I knew she wasn't comein' back
So I turned and walked away
But I still miss her today

I wonder why trains make me lonesome
It happens every time that enginge moan's some
And when I hear that whistle blow
Why it makes my heart sink low
And I wonder why trains make me lonesome

Were at softest bill
It looks like central station
Thos ink spots look like engine number nine
And this couch on which I lay
Supposed to hall my blues away
That ol' pipe
That keep smokin'
Is like a cold engine smokin'

Dass jeder wind daran vorber lief
Ich habe da dein blut gesphrt
Und wie es heiss zu mir herberrann

Du hast nur mein gesicht berhrt
Da starb er einfach hin der harte mann
Weils solche liebe nicht mehr gibt
Ich hab mich in dein rotes haar verliebt

Im feld den ganzen sommer war
Der mohn so rot nicht wie dein rotes haar
Jetzt wird es abgemht das gras
Die bunten blumen welken auch dahin

Und wenn der rote mohn so blass geworden ist
Dann hat es keinen sinn
Dass es noch weisse wolken gibt
Ich hab mich in dein rotes haar verliebt

Du sagst dass es bald kinder gibt
Wenn man sich in dein rotes haar verliebt
So rot wie mohn so wei wie schnee
Du bleibst im winter auch mein rotes reh

Ich hab mich in dein rotes haar verliebt

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

We like you to meet a friend of ours who goes by the name killer joe. Picture a so called hippie or hip-cat, standing on a corner in a neatly pressed double breasted, form-fitting pinstripped suit. Pair of pointed toed shoes, with bowed white stitches around the soles. A black shirt, a long white tie. Black pencil mustache, and of course a very wide bim black felt hat. Killer Joe always has a pocket full of loot, but only the kind that jingels, see he likes to play the horses. He is most certainly a ladies man As a matter of fact he is always willing to accept cash contributions from them, for any cause, namely his own. The most important thing that you have to know about Killer Joe that you have to know is that he is very much against manual labor.

CHORUS

CHORUSYou called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on just holding on to time
Now that we're living separate lives

Well I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
And you make it stronger

Well you have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Some day I might (I might) find myself looking in your eyes
But for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Separate livesThere'll be some slow walkin'
Gonna be some sad talkin'
There'll be some flowers bringin'
Gonna be some sad singin' over you
I said over you
Over you, pretty baby if I ever hear you say we're through

There'll be some long black limousines
People peepin' from their window screens
Parade of cars with their headlights on
All of that will be goin' on over you
I said over you
Over you, pretty baby if I ever hear you say we're through

There'll be a hole about six feet deep
For you baby to take your sleep
Into a pine box and down you'll go
Where you will stay where it's free of snow over you
I said over you
Over you, pretty baby if I ever hear you say we're through

All your folks will be dressed in black
Ride a long black Cadillac
Yeah, baby they'll be puttin' you away
The funeral home'll have good business that day over you
I said over you
Over you, pretty baby if I ever hear you say we're through

Said I want to slay you baby, whoa now
Over you, pretty baby if I ever hear you say we're through

Say you'll never leave me
I said you'll never leave me
Said I'm gonna get rid of you, baby if I ever hear you say we're through

Whoa, I love you
No tellin' what I'd do
That's why baby I want to do all these things to youWhen I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I amI'm goin' to Louisiana
And get me a mojo hand
I'm goin' to Louisiana
And get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna fix my woman so
She can't have no other man

Cold ground was my bed last night
Rocks was my pillow too
Cold ground was my bed last night
Rocks was my pillow too
I woke up this morning, I'm wondering
What in the world am I gonna do?

I lay down thinking
Buy me a mojo hand
I lay down thinking
Buy me a mojo hand
I did wanna fix my woman so she can't have no other man

But don't let your woman
Fix you like mine fixed me
Don't let your woman, boy, fix you like mine fixed me
She make a fool about her, oh, about as a fool can be

Now, can't a woman act funny
Ha-ha-ha, when she got another man?
Can't a woman act funny
When she got another man?
You know, she won't look straight at you
Then she's always raisin' sand, sand

Well, I'm going tomorrow
But I won't be gone long
I'm going tomorro
But I won't be gone very long
I'm gonna get me a mojo hand, I'm gonna bring it back home

That's what I'm gonna doJingle bells, jingle bells

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as he

Whoa

God knows you put your life into it's hands
And it's both cradled you and crushed
But now it's time to make your own demands
Whoa

All these years later and it's killing me
Your broken records in words
Ten thousand craters where it all should be
Whoa

No need to put your words into my mouth
Don't need convincing at all
I love this place enough to know I have no doubts
Whoa

It's a mess, it's a start
It's a flawed work of art
Your city, your a call
Every crack, every wall
Pick a side, pick a fight
Get your epitaph right
You can sing, 'til you drop
Cause the fun just never stops

I love this city tonight
I love this city always
It bears it's teeth like a light
And spits me out after day's
But we're all gluttons for it
We know what's wrong and it's right
For every time it's been hit
Take back the city tonight

Tell me you never wanted more than this

I love this city tonight
I love this city alwaysI left my home in Norfolk Virginia
California on my mind
I Straddled that Greyhound,
and rolled in into Raleigh and all across Carolina

Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rollin' out of Georgia state

We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,
Half way 'cross Alabam
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There are people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands,
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh when The pilot told me in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate

Swing low chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone

Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten O nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
And the poor boy's on the lineSomewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

And while my bottle keeps a-talkin' to me it don't need you around
But tomorrow ain't gonna hold me no big surprise
I'll have a hunk in mind and a pair of bloodshot eyes.

'Cause I've got heartaches and hangovers since you've been gone
Heartaches and hangovers now I'm all alone
Lock the door and disconnect the phone
'Cause I've got heartaches and hangovers since you've been gone.

As the days go by I'm a-drinkin' more and more
Well, I like it like that
My only friend is down at the liquor store
I buy the jug it takes away the pain
And I'm a-knowin' tomorrow that things will be the same.

'Cause I have heartaches and hangovers since you've been gone
Heartaches and hangovers now I'm all alone
I lock the door and disconnect the phone

Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand
It's pointing at your head
You think you're mad too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West end town
Call the police there's a mad man around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West end town

In a West end town a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls

Faces on posters too many choices

Have you got it do you get it

I'll be seeing you,
In every lovely, summer's day,

I'll always think of you that way,
I'll find you in the morning sun,
And when the night is new,
I'll be looking at the moon,
But I'll be seeing you.Trees swayin' in the summer breeze
Showin' off their silver leaves
As we walked by

Soft kisses on a summer's day
Laughing all our cares away
Just you and I

Sweet sleepy warmth of summer nights
Gazing at the distant lights
In the starry sky

They say that all good things must end some day
Autumn leaves must fall
But don't you know that it hurts me so
To say goodbye to you
Wish you didn't have to go
No, no, no, no

Staring at the wall
Open up my window
Head falls out the door

No one else around
And a shimmer takes my eye
I lift my head
Blinded by the sky

Feel my weight in front
Following the sound
Moves away so fast
Falling to the ground

I know what is more to come
Jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me
Chasing down the street (down the street, down the street, down the street)

Give my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast
That I can't keep up
I'm chasing

Give my love to a shooting star

I'm in love with a shooting star
But she moves so fast
When she falls then
I'll be waitingI never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the lightYo
Woo, ooo

Sorry, if I'm perfect
Sorry, I don't give a
(What)
Sorry, I ain't a diva
Sorry, just know what I want
Sorry, I'm not a virgin
Sorry, I'm not a slut

I won't let you break me
Think what you want
(Ohh, aaa, ohh)

To all my dreamers out there
I'm with you
To all my underdogs
Haa, I feel you
Lift your head high
And stay strong
Keep pushin' on
AahAnother summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home

Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you?
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another airplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day has come and gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
And I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I'm coming back home
Let me go home

I'll be home tonight

(Yeah)If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
Cause there's too many places I've got to see
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you can not change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you can not change
And this bird you can not change
Lord knows, I can't change

Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you'll never change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you can not change
And this bird you can not change
Lord knows, I can't change
Lord help me, I can't change
Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeahWithout a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong a man ain't got a friend
Without a song
That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no how
Without a song 
I got my trouble and woe but, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll 
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song
I've-a got my trouble and woe and, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
I'll-a never know what makes that rain to fall
I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a songLet's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the starsEvery afternoon when I wake up
I say a little prayer and I drink up
I thank the Lord for driving me home
Once more...

There's an open bottle on the table
And an empty bottle on the floor
Last night I thought I'd died
And I went to Whiskey Heaven

You know the sun never shines in Whiskey Heaven
It rains Jack Daniels all the time
There's a price you pay, hang overs everyday
Flying high with honky tonk angels in Whiskey Heaven

There's a run down bar, it's a open all night
When me and my friends can get tight
Underneath the neon lights
In Whiskey Heaven

Well we drank a little beer and wine
We stay drunk most of the time
We're always raisin' hell all night
In Whiskey Heaven

You know the sun never shines in Whiskey Heaven
It rains Jack Daniels all the time
There's a price you pay, hang overs everyday
Flying high with honky tonk angels in Whiskey Heaven

Fly high with honky tonk angels in Whiskey Heaven
Fly high with honky tonk angels in Whiskey HeavenDa da da de da da da
Da da da de da da da
Let's go

It's not easy making a name for yourself
Where do you draw the line?
I never thought I'd be in this far
Let's have some fun and never change that for anyone
Try not to miss me when I'm gone

Ooh, ooh

I sold my soul to the open road
Now I live my life alone
You'll find me in the same spot believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down

Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leavin' and not coming back

You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

I'm gonna need you to try to follow along
I did the best that I could to try to write you songs
Now go tell them we sold out, like we're the ones who changed
I write what I feel, I say what I mean
You can't buy sincerity

I sold my soul to the open road
Now I live my life alone
You'll find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down

Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leavin' and not coming back

You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

Don't forget yourselves, we've made up our minds
We signed 3, 4, 5 on the dotted lines

Don't forget yourselves, we've made up our minds
We signed 3, 4, 5 on the dotted lines

You'll find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leavin' and not coming back
You're right and I was wrong

You'll find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down

Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leavin' and not coming back

You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all, this town will be the downfall of us all
Downfall of us all
Downfall of us all
Downfall of us all
Downfall of us allThere are desperate times upon us,
There are codes of white and black,
Political resentment and people start to crack,
There's hate and opposition,
There's fumbling dialog,
Yet you sit there and judge me
And you think it makes a difference

If you think I'm all alone you are foolishly wrong,
There's an entire army who blindly follow along,
And you happen to be one of them believe it or not,
Even though you try not to be we are of the same plague

The other ways we're taught to fear,
Don't even scratch the surface of the problem here,
I'm not blind, and I'm not scared,
So many crucial factors exist out there,
And we're but one, and they're bout two,
And how we come to terms will help us pull through

Things cannot change too fast,
It took us this much time,
To reach our current platform and walk this fragile line,
If I thought I'd make a difference I'd kill myself today,
But so many are like me lost in the fray

You create your own reality,
And leave mine to meSome time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant "Please love me"
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

Bésame tu a mí
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Qui mi locura te dió
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Why la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir why amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesíCome back

[Chorus: x 3]

I will go all the way down
I'll make it feel so good
I want to do you right
If i could just make love to you

Which hold one race superior and another
Inferior

And permanently
Discredited

Until the color of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the color of his eyes
Me say war

That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war

Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued,

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my headI come awake
With the gift for womankind
You're still asleep
the gift don't seem to mind

Rise on this occasion
Halfway up your back
Sliding down your body
Touching your behind

You look so self-possessed
I won't disturb your rest
Its lovely when you're sleeping
But wide awake is best

Ow, wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
I don't want to make you
I'll let the fancy take you
And you'll wake up and make love

You come awake
In a horny morning mood
And well have a proper wriggle
In the naughty, naked nude

Roll against my body
Get me where you want me
What happens next is private
Its also very rude

I'll go and get the post
And make some tea and toast
You have another sleep 
It's me that needs it most

Ow, wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star

Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

As I was walking with a friend of mine

How she was smelling like the summer time

Changed everything, about that, come on girl

It feels so good, loving you

It feels so good, and I need oxygen,
Little bit of heaven doin' 24-7 again

Just a few tough demands
On a personal friend I could lean on
Desperate and selfish, I know that I was
We drank all our fill
But I'd swear there was poison in my cup
Of your good intentions what has become
I thought you were on my side
Must you add the weight
You said it would be even
When splitting up the stakes
I thought you were on my side
Were we not the rage
Down the center line
What's yours is yours and mine
Just like always
Hurting for freedom, hell-bent for lust
It's an unlikely thing that I'd be bumping in
To someone I could trust
I'm far from resigning
Though I'm faint from exhaust
Just because I'm on edge
Do I have to let somebody come push me off
Is it the belonging, or something you've lost
I thought you were on my side
Must you add the weight
You said it would be even
When splitting up the stakes
I thought you were on my side
Were we not the rage
Down the center line
What's yours is yours and mine

I'll tell you a story
I'll dance when she's done
(You're behind, Louise, catch up baby, catch up)
By the time we're through entertaining you
You'll have a barrel of fun
The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
"Let yourself go!" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
"It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear,

Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won as we sailed into the mystic
Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic

And when that fog horn blows I will be coming home
And when the fog horn blows I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And magnificently we will flow into the mystic

When that fog horn blows you know I will be coming home
And when that fog horn whistle blows I got to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And together we will flow into the mystic

I want to rock your soul
Into the mysticYou fire words, but all they do is ricochet
You think I'm payin' the price, but its not costing me
Your love was a waste of time
You've been left behind
You made no mark on me, you're gone and you left no sign
You're not on my mind, don't try to press rewind

Its like walking on snow, without leavin' a trace
When all that you said never carried no weight
I came out untouched and in another place
When you gonna get it, I'm so unaffected

When I was flyin' high, you tried to clip my wings
You shot my out of the sky
You tried to make it up buyin' expensive things
Your love was a waste of time
You've been left behind
You made no mark on me, you're gone and you left no sign
You're not on my mind, don't try to press rewind

Its like walking on snow, without leavin' a trace
When all that you said never carried no weight
I came out untouched and in another place
When you gonna get it, I'm so unaffected
Its like walking on snow, without leavin' a trace
You're not gonna see, gonna see this heart break
You huff and you puff but I'm not blowin' away
When you gonna get it, I'm so unaffected

You try and find, find fault in me
Project yourself, hate so easily
You already lost so you push me more
Cause I didn
T buy it so, so you push me so

1, 2, 3, 4

Its like walking on snow, without leavin' a trace
When all that you said never carried no weight
I came out untouched and in another place
When you gonna get it, I'm so unaffected
Its like walking on snow, without leavin' a trace
You're not gonna see, gonna see this heart break
You huff and you puff but I'm not blowin' away
When you gonna get it, I'm so unaffected
When you gonna get it, I'm so unaffectedOne is a spirit of Christmas
It is the celebration of the birth of the Christ child!
This we will never forget!
Oh, this we will never forget!
But there are other little things too!
Yes, there are other little things too!

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,
Jack Frost nipping at your nose,
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways:
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas to you! Merry Christmas to you!
To you!
Merry Christmas everybody and a Happy New Year!
To you!Hey driver, where we're going
I swear my nerves are showing
Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die
Comes the morning and the headlights fade away
Hundred thousand people, I'm the one they blame
I've been waiting long for one of us to say
Save the darkness, let it never fade away
In the living daylights.

All right, hold on tighter now
It's down, down to the wire
Set your hopes way too high
The living's in the way we die
Comes the morning and the headlights fade in rain
Hundred thousand changes, everything's the same
I've been waiting long for one of us to say
Save the darkness, let it never fade away
In the living daylights.

Comes the morning and the headlights fade away
Hundred thousand people, I'm the one they frame
In the living daylights.Like a believer 
We are out to find 

Like a believer 
We are living our minds 

Like a believer 
We don't waste any time

We stand our ground 

I just can't understand this 
Why it's so hard 
To take each other by the hand and 
And say that I love you 

Like a believer 
We can't let this go 

NO MORE WAR, NO MORE WAR, NO MORE WAR

Just say that I love you

We got to find a way 

To come together 
And make a better way 

I can't understand this

Them apart

Just say that I love you 

This World is in trouble
We got to find the WayIt's time to say goodbye for now
We'll have our second time around
But before we go
There's something I'd like to say

Every thing's not what it seems
There's a stronger force behind the scenes
He's in our lives every day
He's right there when we call

In Him is where our strength lies
I'll lift my eyes beyond the skies
Only He can save my life
And only He can hear my cry

I wanna thank You, God
For giving me one more chance
To raise my voice and to sing Your praise
I sing it out loud, I sing it all day

This song in my prayer
I give to only You
It can't compare to the gift from You
He gave us His love, He gave us His Son
Oh yeah, Jesus

I know there's some who don't believe
Some times it's very hard to see
Oh, we live this old life every day
Some things don't go your way

But to be without is not His will, no
There's cattle on a thousand hills
And they're all yours to claim
Claim them in His holy name

See, we don't have to beg or crawl, no
He'll see you standing proud and tall
He'll give His everlasting love
Come to Him as you are

I wanna thank You, God
For giving me one more chance
To raise my voice and sing Your praise
I sing it out loud, hey, I sing it all day

This song is my prayer
I give to only You
It can't compare to the gift from You, oh
See, He gave us His love, He gave us His Son

I wanna thank You, God
For giving me one more chance
To raise my voice and to sing Your praise
I sing it out loud, oh, I sing it all day

Said, it's my prayer
I give to only You, yeah
It can't compare to the gift from You, yeah yeah
You gave us Your love, You gave us Your son

Now I say Amen
God, our Father, Father
I say Amen, I say AmenE ritorno da te nonostante il mio orgoglio 
Io ritorno perché altra scelta non see'è 
Ricordando i giorni a un'altra latitudine 
Frequentando i posti dove ti vedrei 
Recitando i gesti e le parole che ho perso 
Ee ritorno da te dal silenzio che è in me 

Tu dimmi se see'è ancora per me 
Un'altra occasione,  un'altra emozione 
Se ancora sei tu 
Ancora di più un'altra canzone fresca e nuova 
Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi see'è ancora Dentro agli occhi tuoi 
Oh no... gli occhi tuoi 

E ritorno da te perchè ancora ti voglio 
E ritorno da te contro il vento che see'è 
Io ritorno perchè ho bisogno di te 
Di respirare fuori da questa inquietudine 
E ritrovare mani forti su di me 
E non sentirmi sempre così fragile 

Tu dimmi solo se see'è ancora per me 
Un'altra occasione, un'altra emozione 
Dimmi se ancora sei tu 
Ancora di più la nostra canzone che risuona 
Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi see'è ancora Dentro gli occhi tuoi, oh no.. 

Se ancora sei tu 
Una canzone fresca e nuova 
Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi see'è ancora Dentro agli occhi tuoi, 
Oh no... gli occhi tuoi 
Dimmi solo se see'è e ritorno da teDrive boy dog boy

Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Há sempre uma mulher feliz

CARELESS ABANDON, LEAVING YOU STRANDED. THIS ROAD'S NOT PAVED WITH GOLD. 
OUTSIDE THE WORLD GOES, ON AND ON WITHOUT YOU, AS YOUR DREAMS GROW OLD. 
( CHORUS )
IT'S ONLY A MOMENT WE GET THIS IN THIS LIFETIME BEFORE YOU NOTICE IT'S GONE.
Everybody knows down ladbrook grove,
you have to leap across the street.
You can lose your life under a taxi cab,
you gotta have eyes in your feet. 

You find a nice soft corner and you sit right down,
pick up your guitar and play.
Then the police come and says move along,
so you move along all day. 

I'm a one man band
nobody cares or understands.
Is there anybody out there who could lend a hand.
To my one man band. 

For three days now I haven't eaten at all
my my I must be getting so thin.
Soon my cap won't be large enough
to drop a half a crown in. 

So hey there mister don't you look so sad
don't look so ill at ease.
I can play you any song you chose
to cheer up the life you lead. 

Oh I'm a one man band
nobody sees nor understands.
Is there anybody out there who could lend a hand
to my one man band. 

And oh oh oh look at the rain falling
oh oh oh look at the rain 

Nobody hears the minstrel boy, as he sings his tale of woe.
Nobody sees him disappear,
and nobody sees him go.
So hey there mister don't look so sad,
don't feel so ill at ease.
I can play you any song you chose,
to cheer up the life you lead. 

Oh I'm a one man band
nobody sees nor understands.
Is there anybody out there who could lend me a hand,

Ooo one man band
Ooo I'm a one man band
Oh I'm a one man band
Ooo one man band As I lay here in my bed,
Racing thoughts run through my head
I just saw you passin' by
You stopped to look me in the eye

I thought i'd leave it up to time
to somehow shake you from my mind
Your kisses soft and your eyes so deep
Let's not forget your pretty lies to me

Cuz I,
Thought that memories died
I Guess they know where to hide
I wanna forget you,But how could I?
I thought that memories died

I've forgiven everything
Oh I can't forget the pain
your eyes they haunt my memories
Even though you're gone

Oh..............

Well I know from time to time
That you have me on your mind
Oh I loved you tenderly
But somehow you slipped away from me

I Thought that memories died
I guess they know where to hide
I wanna forget you
But......how....... could......... I..........
I thought that memories died

Oh.....................

I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories died
I thought that memories diedThe look
As she pass she flashed that come-hither look
The look
That was meant for me and for me alone

The look
Would be out of place in a children's book
The look
That could chip a piece off a heart of stone

Consider a bit this interesting little tableau
A look I could read but where would it lead me to
But mischievous elf I labeled myself diablo
And did just exactly what she was sure I'd do
Now at her beck and call
She ties me to the strings of her Spanish shawl
That isn't all
One foot out the door and she gives me the look

I say goodbye now she puts her foot down
I'm flying high now that's when I'm put down
I want to die now she puts her foot down
Freezes me with the look

Someday if she sashays by you and looks your way
I'd say you'll do well if you overlook the look
The look
The lookA little

I saw you today
You smiled
You looked happy with him
So I tried to Smile
I told you I was strong now
But Baby I Lied
I was dying inside

[Chorus]
Still, after all of this time
One look at you stops this whole world of mine
Still, just the thought of your kiss
I close my eyes I can taste your sweet lips
You get to me
You always have, always will
Girl you make my heart
Stand still

I tried, I tried to be strong and move on
Believe me I tried
But then, I realized 
There's no way I can win
When my whole world is turning
In the palm of your hand
And I'm left standing

[Chorus]

Now everyday is the same
Nothing has changed
You're all I see in my mind
I'd beg, steal, I'll borrow
For just one tomorrow
But here I am frozen inside
[Chorus]

Girl you make my heart
Stand StillWelcome to the astronomical club
The rocket shell is now ready to take off

It's better not to know

Dreams, gigantic stars
Comets and meteors
Enormous mushrooms
Volcanic explosions

All of you will be back home safely
So don't hesitate, join us with no fear
On our fantastic trip to the moonNight time slows, raindrops splash rainbows
Perhaps someone you know, could sparkle and shine
As daydreams slide to color from shadow
Picture the moonglow, that dazzles my eyes
And I love you

Just lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple everytime
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple everytime

Dreams of sights, of sleigh rides in seasons
Where feelings not reasons, can make you decide
As leaves pour down, splash autumn on gardens
As colder nights harden, their moonlit delights
And I love you

Just lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time

Look at me with starry eyes
Push me up to starry skies
There's stardust in my head
Pure and simple every time
Fresh and deep as oceans new
Shiver at the sight of you
I'll sing a softer tune
Pure and simple over you

If love's the truth then look no lies
And let me swim around your eyes
I've found a place I'll never leave
Shut my mouth and just believe
Love is the truth I realize
Not a stream of pretty lies
To use us up and waste our time

Lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time

Look at me with starry eyes
Push me up to starry skies
There's stardust in my head
Pure and simple every time
Fresh and deep as oceans new
Shiver at the sight of you
I'll sing a softer tune
Pure and simple over you
Pure and simple just for youNo one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me

But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheating heart will tell on you

No, don't let me down, do-do-downHere we all work 'long the Mississippi 
Here we all work while the white folk play 
Pulling' them boats from the dawn till sunset 
Getting no rest till the judgement day 
Don't look up and don't look down 
You don't dare make the white boss frown
Bend your knees and bow your head 
And pull that rope until you're dead 
Let me go 'way from the Mississippi 
Let me go 'way from the white man boss 
Show me that stream called the River Jordan 
That's the old stream that I long to cross 
Old Man River, that Old Man River 
He must know something, but he don't say nothing 
He just keeps rolling, he keeps on rolling along 
He don't plant taters, and he don't plant cotton 
And them what plants 'em is soon forgotten 
But Old Man River, jest keeps rolling along 
You and me, we sweat and strain 
Bodies all aching and wracked with pain 
Tote that barge and lift that bale 
You get a little drunk and you land in jail 
I get weary and so sick of trying 
I'm tired of living, but I'm feared of dying 
And Old Man River, he just keeps rolling alongIf I was a cloud, I'd make baby raindrops
And they'd feed the treetops
If I was a cloud
If I was the sun, I'd shine on the flowers
And pass on the power
If I was the sun
If I was the moon, I'd caress every ocean
In celestial motion
If I was the moon
If I was a star, charmed and enchanted
All wishes would be granted
If I was a star

If I was your man, the kisses would linger
I'd melt in your fingers
If I was your man
If I was your man, we'd share every shower
And wash away the hours baby
If I was your man

If I was a song, I'd reach all the people
From barrooms to steeples
If I was a song
If I was a dream, I'd be sweeter than honey
I'd be bigger than money
If I was a dream

If I was your man, we'd dance through the daisies
They'd say we were crazy girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, I'd pump you with this passion
You'd get more than fashion baby

If I-I-I-I-I was your man
You would not have to hurry
I'd rub away your worries girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, then we'd be together
Now and forever baby
If I was your man

And if we were love, we'd heal every nation
We'd be on everybody's station
If we were love

If I was your man, sweet lovin' man
If I was your man
If I was your manI tried to live six years ago
When this story started
The sun, it told me where to go
Open minded, open hearted

[Chorus:]
Freedom
Freedom was my vision
Every breath a dream
A million years ahead
All is what it seems
Freedom was my vision
Every breath a dream

Or are you taking by surprise
Covering your sleepy eyes
The mocking bird won't sing for you
What ever happened
To these friends I knew

These friends I knew
Or was it just a dream
Dreams are for real
Life is only how you feel

[Chorus]
Freedom
Freedom is my vision
Every breath I dream
A million dreams I had
And they're all for real
Freedom is my vision
Every breath I dream

Breathe onBlood is pumping, blood is pumping, blood is pumping
Blood is pumping, blood is pumping, blood is pumping
Blood is pumping, blood is pumping, blood is pumping

Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you
 
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
'Round wonderful you!I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.(brooker / reid) *

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the lighted chandelier
Stands a rusty old retainer
Whose old eyes are filled with tears
For his master, good sir galant,
Who is now off to the wars
And although his eyes are crying
We know grief is not the cause
And if grief is not the reason
He must be of sterner stuff
And his sword though old and rusty
Must be blunt as sharp enough

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the broken window pane
Stand the remnants of the evening
Who are waiting all in vain
For the crowing of the cockerel
Showing morning is not night
But the air is filled with silence
And the daylight is not bright
But still darkness is no reason
We are men of sterner stuff
And our swords though old and rusty
Still are blunt as sharp enough.

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the hat-stand in the hall
Waiting only for the morning
Shadows flitting 'cross the wall
And perhaps that old retainer
Whom now giving of his all
May have once been just as we are
And now has no face at all.
But still grief was not the reason
He was made of sterner stuff
And his sword though old and rusty
Still was blunt as sharp enough.

Looking for a place called the Chicken Shack
They only serve warm beer rice and beans
But it feels just like it's down in New Orleans
Brace yourself baby I'm here to attack
Down at the place called the Chicken Schack

The girls at that place are mighty fine
But stay off sadie green cause that girl is mine
The moonlight shines through the holes in the wall
Everybody there is having a ball
They don't care that the place looks like a wreck
Down at the place called the Chicken Shack

I want to rip it, rock it, really bop it
Flip it, flop it, David Crocket
Just like Roy Montrell everytime he hears hat mellow saxophone
The good old rockin' days will never come back
Except down at the place called the Chicken Shack

The good old rockin days will never come back
Except down at the place called the Chicken Shack

Something we don't know what

How much to discover
What chemical forces flow from lover to lover!
How little we understand what touches off that tingle,

When does a holding keep me locked away
No chance was given to find myself today
My time of aging wonder when I'll die
But when my time will come I know the reason why!
I have an escape

Alone it keeps me safe and in my home
I have to use it
To keep me satisfied until I'm gone
Don't regret the rules I broke
When I die bury me in smoke!

Under the world I wait for my fate
My bodies lying beneath my blissful state
My time of aging wonder when I'll die
But when my time will come, I know the reason why
I have to risk it
Alone it keeps me safe and in my home
I have to use it
To keep me satisfied until I'm gone
Don't regret the rules I broke, 
When I die bury me in smoke"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream" she said
"The one that makes me laugh" she said
And threw her arms around my neck

Show me how you do it
And I promise you I promise that
I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways I had
To make her glow
Why are you so far away, she said
Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
That I'm in love with you

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes

And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You
Soft and lonely
You
Lost and lonely
You
Just like heavenDon't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more timeOh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.Story of my life 
Searching for the right 
But it keeps avoiding me 
Sorrow in my soul

Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company 
He's more than a man 
And this is more than love 

The reason that the sky is blue 
The clouds are rollin' in 
Because I'm gone again 
And to him I just can't be true 

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful 
And it kills him inside 
To know that I am happy with some other guy 
I can see him dying 

[Chorus]
I don't want to do this anymore 
I don't want to be the reason why 
Every time I walk out the door 
I see him die a little more inside 
I don't want to hurt him anymore 
I don't want to take away his life 
I don't want to be a murderer 

I feel it in the air 
As I'm doin' my hair 
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek 

As he reluctantly 
Asks if I'm gonna be out late 
I say "I won't be long. 
Just hangin' with the girls." 
A lie I didn't have to tell 

Because we both know 
Where I'm about to go 
And we know it very well 

Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful 
And it kills him inside 
To know that I am happy with some other guy 
I can see him dying 

[Chorus]

Our love 
His trust 
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head 
Get it over with 

I don't want to do this 
Anymore 
Whoa-oh 
Anymore

[Chorus]

A murderer 

No, no, no, yeah, yeah
