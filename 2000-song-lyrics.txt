Lightning smashing on heavy like beat
Excuse me the diff but I just can’t wait
Deep in a dungeon that’s rattling the chains
Man got to fight, he’s gonna eat my brain

It feels so good to be afraid
Vincent Price is back again

The heart pumping now, the music sound of time
The vampire’s dying, he’s got him wild
Red blood dripping, she doesn’t have a prayer
I know it’s not real but I just don’t care

It feels so good to be afraid
Vincent Price is back again

I want seven screaming virgins on a sacrificial altar
Hell and God, screeching doors, zombies, aaaaah!Love you turning all my pages
Love you wearing my robes
Wide awake in cold England
After the door is closed

Fine to learn another language
Fine to spin a white thread
Who’s a garbage man? Who’s a chief?
Who’s a monkey in my bed?

And it’s a fine
Baby, it’s just a timeshare
It’s a fine contagious disease
And it’s a fine swirling white guardsman
Lay a tombstone on me

Stop yearning, stop burning
Staying out late at night
Showing her the proper courtship
Make her mama feel all right

Come along a good husband
Come along a fair bride
Call the latest inception
And you look clean inside

And its a fine
Baby, it’s a just a timeshare
It’s fine contagious disease
And its a fine swirling white guardsman
Lay a tombstone on me

In tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire
To tear their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules that the greatest fools obey
Because the sun is much too sultry
And one must avoid its ultra violet ray
 
Papalaka papalaka papalaka boo

Digariga digariga digariga doo
Digariga digariga digariga doo
 
The native grieve when the white 
Men leave their huts, because
They're obviously definitely nuts!
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to
The Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindoos and Argentines sleep 
Firmly from twelve to one
But Englishmen detest a siesta
In the Philippines
There are lovely screens

To protect you from the glare
In the Malay States
There are hats like plates
Which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon
And no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete
They're quite impervious to heat
When the white man rides every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he
Will impale his solar topee on a tree

When the English claim
The earth that they give rise to 
Such hilarity and mirth

Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The toughest Burmese bandit
Can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon
Is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down
And lie down in a jungle town

Where the sun beats down
To the rage of man and beast
The English garb
Of the English sahib
Merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok
At twelve o'clock
They foam at the mouth and run
Slut mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The smallest Malay rabbit
Deplores this stupid habit in Hongkong
They strike a gong and
Fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate
Who's in late

In the mangrove swamps
Where the python romps
There is peace from twelve till two
Even caribous
Lie around and snooze
For there's nothing else 
To do in Bengal to move 
At all is seldom, if ever done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sunSomething's wrong man when the boss man makes you beg
For your own paycheck,
With his sweaty chest and his cigarette breath,
Breathing right down your neck.
Another fat face in the rat race, keeps feeding me do's and don't's,
Well it's the weekend so take your clock, stick it in and break if off,
I got plans of my own.

Tonight there's beer that needs drinking, Merle Haggard that needs singing
A couple of boys that need to go ahead and fight, that's right!
Beer cans that need stacking, pool balls that need racking,
That's the only quota I'm meeting tonight.
So, if you're with me raise your glass, here's to the working class
Everybody else can just kiss my ass.

Uncle Sam says pay your taxes, neighbors say mow your grass,
Signs here and there, tell me when and where I can
Smoke my damn cigarettes.
So, if you think you need another piece of me,
Well hunker down and pucker up,
Put your rosy red lips on the lower hips, go on and get you some.

Mean, mean stride
Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride

Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift

The world is, the world is

Maybe as his skies are wide
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you
And the space he invades, he gets by on you

No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is

And what you say about his company

Sailing over a muslin tree

Welcome to my worldI find you in the morning
After dreams of distant signs
You pour yourself over me
Like the sun through the blinds

You lift me up
And get me out
Keep me walking
But never shout

Hold the secret close
I hear you say

You know the way
It throws about
It takes you in
And spits you out

It spits you out
When you desire
To conquer it
To feel you're higher

To follow it
You must be clean
With mistakes
That you do mean

Move the heart
Switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place

On and on it goes
Calling like a distant wind
Through the zero hour we'll walk
We'll cut the thick and break the thin
No sound to break no moment clear
When all the doubts are crystal clear
Crashing hard into the secret wind

You know the way
It twists and turns
Changing color
Spinning yarns

You know the way
It leaves you dry
It cuts you up
And takes you high

You know the way
It's painted gold
Is it honey
Is it gold

You know the way
It throws about
It takes you in
And spits you out

Oh, cuts you up
Oh, cuts you up
Oh, cuts you up
Oh, la la la la la la la la

You know the way
It throws about
It takes you in
And spits you out

It spits you out
When you desire
To conquer it
To feel you're higher

To follow it
You must be clean
With mistakes
That you do mean

Move the heart
Switch the pace
Look for what
Seems out of place

Oh, cuts you up
Oh, cuts you up

It's o.k.
It goes this way
The line is thin
It twists away

Cuts you up
And spits you out
Keeps you walking
But never shout

Oh
OhI am the Blackman and you are the white
I am the deviant and you're always right
I am the darkness and you are the light
I am the Blackman, you're the white

Yeah, I'm the good little holier than thou, hide my head in my hand
I hear no, see no, speak no, no, no, no understand

Well, I am the blackness, I am the dark
I am the alcoholic beast in a park
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark
I am the truth of it, you are the hypocrite

I am the dirty and you are the clean
I live in places where you've never been
I eat the garbage and you eat the cream
I am the dirty, you're the clean

You give me the third degree for being different to thee
You hit me, you kick me, you tell me [Incomprehensible] I should be

Well, I am the blackness, I am the dark
I am the alcoholic beast in a park
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark
I am the truth of it, you are the hypocrite

I am the white man, I paint you black
I am the traitor but I put you on the whack
I am the coward, I shoot you in the back
I am the white man, I paint you black

Yeah, I'm the good little holier than thou, hide my head in my hand
I hear no, see no, speak no, no, no, no understand

Well, I am the blackness, I am the dark
I am the alcoholic beast in a park
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark
I am the truth of it, you are the hypocrite

Say I am the blackness, I am the dark
I am the alcoholic beast in a park
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark
I am the truth of it, you are the hypocrite

Il avait de grands yeux très clairs
Où parfois passaient des éclairs
Comme au ciel passent des orages
Il avait plein de tatouages

Que j'ai jamais très bien compris
Son cou portait, "pas vu, pas pris"
Sur son cœur on lisait, "personne"
Sur son bras droit un mot, "raisonne"

Je sais pas son nom, je ne sais rien de lui
Il m'a aimée toute la nuit
Mon légionnaire
Et me laissant à mon destin

Il est parti dans le matin
Plein de lumière!
Il était mince, il était beau
Il sentait bon le sable chaud

Mon légionnaire!
Y avait du soleil sur son front
Qui mettait dans ses cheveux blonds
De la lumière!

Bonheur perdu, bonheur enfui
Toujours je pense à cette nuit
Et l'envie de sa peau me ronge
Parfois je pleure et puis je songe

Que lorsqu'il était sur son cœur
J'aurais dû crier mon bonheur
Mais je n'ai rien osé lui dire
J'avais peur de le voir sourire!

Je sais pas son nom, je ne sais rien de lui
Il m'a aimée toute la nuit

Qui mettait dans ses cheveux blonds
De la lumière

On l'a trouvé dans le désert
Il avait ses beaux yeux ouverts
Dans le ciel passaient des nuages
Il a montré ses tatouages

En souriant puis il a dit
Montrant son cou, "pas vu, pas pris"
Montrant son cœur, "ici personne"
Il ne savait pas, je lui pardonne

Je rêvais pourtant que le destin
Me ramènerait un beau matin
Mon légionnaire

Qu'on s'en irait loin, tous les deux
Dans quelque pays merveilleux
Plein de lumière

Il était mince, il était beau
On l'a mis sous le sable chaud
Mon légionnaire

Y avait du soleil sur son front
Qui mettait dans ses cheveux blonds
De la lumièreI'm down on my knees will you forgive me
I failed a million times
I treated you so bad
How can you still love me
You wiped my weeping eyes as I cry
I'm so unworthy to be by your side
And I will never forget this moment in time
I'll be needing you in my life

I'll never find another love
I'll never find another you
I'll never find another heart
As pure and true
I love you and everything about you

So lost in a world filled with temptation
I just cannot let go
The ocean surround me
I was sinking so quickly
Holding on I tried as I swallow my pride
I saw life flashing before my eyes
Right then I knew
It was just a matter of time
I'll be needing you in my life

I'll never find another love
I'll never find another love

I'll unbreak your heart
I'm sorry I disappoint you
I love you so much
I'm starting right here
I'm starting right now
Forever I will serve
You'll be honest and true

All your life have been living lies
Locked inside your false paradise
Your problem is you're too blind to see
You have false illusions of being free
Catch up on reality
You're living in a dream
Your mind is twisted,
Nothing is what it seems

[Chorus] 
It all comes clearer as the smokescreen falls
You open up your ears
To hear my calls then you'll know what you need
Can't tell that the dust of angels leads you straight to hell

To play the game you must pay the cost
But you'll be long gone before you're lost
Then you'll be trapped in a giant web
And some sunny day you will end up dead.Why boasteth thyself, O evil men
Playing smart and-a not being clever!
I said you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity (if a-so, a-so),
But the goodness of Jah - Jah

So if you are the big tree,
We are the small axe

Look who's on the skids this time
Bitchin' 'bout her place in line
And all you really want is attention
'Cause you're like every other girl uptown
Who wants to ride her face around
And wave about that power you have to put me down
And so I'll tell ya
To see you like this is nearly tragic
But it's like Ruby says our dreams have magic
But I know useless begging won't help me
Yes it's you
You leave me nothing left to say
'Cause I thought that we'd return one day
Together to a great sphere of knowledge
But that would never do for you
'Cause you thought you knew a thing or two
But you don't even know what is and isn't true
And so I'll tell ya
I was a fool that's why I got burned
But in all that time there's one thing I learned
And that is useless begging won't help meIf tomorrow all the things were gone
I worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife

I thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you
And defend Her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt
I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.

From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea

From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
Where's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say

That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died

Then maybe at the closing of your day 
You will sit and watch the moonrise over Claddagh 
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay 
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream 

The women in the meadows making hay 
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin 
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play 
For the breezes blowing over the seas from Ireland 
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow 
And the women in the uplands digging praties 

Speak a language that the strangers do not know 
For the strangers came and tried to teach their way 
They scorned us just for being what we are 
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams 
Or light a penny candle from a star 

And if there is going to be a life hereafter 
And somehow I am sure there's going to be 
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven 
In that dear land across the Irish SeaWell I went down to Houston and I stopped in San Antone
I passed up the station for the bus
Was trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what
I ended up with pockets full of dust. 

So I went on to Cleveland and ended up insane
Bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
I was spending money like the way it likes to rain
And I ended up with pockets full of 'caine. 

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home. 

I ain't never been to Vegas but I gambled up my life
Building news print boats I raced in sewer mains
I was trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what
Funny how they say that some things never change. 

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home. 

Up here in the city it feels like things are closing in
The sunset's just my light bulb burning out
I miss Kentucky and I miss my family
All the sweetest winds they blow across the south.

What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition

Moi je balance du rêve en plein cœur

C'est à Hambourg, à Santiago,
A White Chapel, ou Bornéo,
C'est à Hambourg, à Santiago,
A Rotterdam, ou à Frisco.

C'est à Hambourg, au ciel de pluie,
Qu'il a posé ses mains sur moi
Et qu'il m'a fait crier de joie
En me serrant fort contre lui,
M'a dit "je t'aime!" à plus finir,
"Laisse donc là tous tes marins!
Laisse donc la mer, et puis viens!
Moi, j'ai du bonheur à t'offrir"

"Ma petite gueule"

C'est à Hambourg, au ciel de pluie,
Dans les bastringues à matelots
Que je trimbale encore ma peau,
Les bras ouverts à l'infini.
Car moi je suis comme la mer,
J'ai le cœur trop grand pour un seul gars,
J'ai le cœur trop grand et c'est pour ça
Qu' j'ai pris l'amour sur toute la terre

C'est à Hambourg, à Santiago
A White Chapel, ou Bornéo

So long, boy
Adios, amigo
Nacher, Schatz
Au revoir, petite gueule!I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I dieSing a mean tune, kid
Sock 'em in the gut, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you ever let your mama catch you cryin'
Play the bad song, kid
Everyone's the blues yeah, yeah, yeah
And the people never know you're only lying
What a scary song, kid
Never heard before yeah, yeah, yeah
Soon the groupies will start rolling by your door
Burn the groove to death, kid
Nail 'em to the cross yeah, yeah, yeah
Till you're not a super pop star any moreMe duele mucho el corazón, ya no lo aguanto
Porque he perdido lo que más amaba yo
Se fue con otro y con el pie me dio en la cara
Cuando yo estaba como loco por su amor

De ayer a hoy he llorado veinte lágrimas
De ayer a hoy he sufrido veinte veces
Dios quiera y no vaya ser que no regrese
Porque me muero de sufrir y de llorar

Que ingratitud, cometió, ella conmigo
Sabiendo bien que la amaba con locura
La veneraba como el ángel de mi guarda
Y me dejo para irse a las alturas

De ayer a hoy he llorado veinte lágrimas,
De ayer a hoy he sufrido veinte veces,
Dios quiera y no vaya ser que no regrese
Porque me muero de sufrir y de llorarThere's some out there tonight
Who's lost and lonely, too
There's a heart beating just with mine
There's a voice in the air
But it just can't get through
I'm hoping that someday I'll find someone
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely
I can't face another closing door

Talk to me, open up your heart
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark 
Talk to me, take it from the start
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart

There's a song in the air,
But I can't hear the words
There's a promise that's never made
There's a voice in the streets 
That no one's ever heard
I'm hoping I'll hear it someday calling
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely
I can't face another closing door

Talk to me, open up your heart
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark 
Talk to me, take it from the start
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart

Somewhere there's a voice that's calling
Someone who's alone and falling
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely
I can't face another closing door

Talk to me, open up your heart
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark 
Talk to me, take it from the start
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heartFound the treasure at last
We have to count backwards
You start at the end
'Til we find what we're after

There are two kinds of men
He could never be true
But am I just like him?
Am I unfaithful too?

I was drawing a map
But I couldn't have known
Take a right, take a left
You'll know when you get there

The puzzle will fit
Late one night Montreal
With his clothes on the floor
And his artificial fire

Is there anybody counting
This mathematical equation?
Could there be another answer?
Could I change his mind
Or could he change mine?

Why can't there be one?
He tried to explain
In the dark I would laugh
We were talking and naked

Reading my map
Late one night in Montreal
Found the treasure at last
It was artificial fire

Is there anybody counting
This mathematical equation?
Could there be another answer?
Could he change my mind
Or could I change his mind?

It was new, it was old
From the start it was both
And a year nearly passed
And one night Montreal

I'm a killer at heart
And I wanted to feel
So I laid out my trap
With my artificial fireNow I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt like this before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you

I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone to stand by me
We saw the writing on the wall
And we felt this magical fantasy
Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each others hand
'Cause we seem to understand the urgency

Just remember
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love

Because I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
Hey baby

With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control, no

Yes, I know what's on your mind when you say
"Stay with me tonight" (stay with me)
And remember
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love

Because I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door (never felt this way)
Till I found the truth
And I owe it all to you

Now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road

I remember dear, not long ago, you said you'd be my own

(Alexandre Poulin / Alexandre Poulin)


J’avais sept ans quand j’ai trouvé
Un vieux hockey de gardien de but
Caché dans’ cave, derrière
Une grosse pile de revues

Mon père m’a souri étrangement
Quand il l’a aperçu
Y’a dit : « Habille-toé, mon grand
On s’en va jouer dans’ rue »

Ce soir-là, j’ai compté
Mon premier tour du chapeau
Contre mon père rouillé
Qui se prenait pour Casso

Moi, je maniais
La rondelle comme par magie
J’étais pus un p’tit gars
J’étais Wayne Gretzky

C’est cette nuit-là qu’j’ai vraiment compris
C’que j’allais faire plus tard
Vêtu de bleu, blanc, rouge, j’allais briller
Sur toutes les patinoires

Trois semaines plus tard, j’gagnais ma première coupe Stanley
Faite en papier d’aluminium
En la tenant au-dessus d’moé, j’ai su
C’que c’était que d’être un homme

Pendant des années, j’vous jure
J’ai tout fait pour être repêché
Jusqu’à c’qu’on me dise
Que c’tait pas assez

J’me s’rai tout de même rendu
Jusqu’au junior majeur
Où on m’a dit : « T’as pas les mains
Mais crisse que t’as du cœur »

Chu tombé de mon nuage
J’ai caché mon hockey pis accroché mes patins
En pensant à mon père, qu’y’avait un jour
Lui aussi caché le sien

J’ai pas trouvé les mots pour vous dire
À quel point ça m’a détruit
Aujourd’hui, quand j’y repense, en quelque part
J’m’en suis toujours pas remis

J’ai tout tenté
Pour compenser l’ivresse de jouer
En manquant pas une game
À’ TV

Pis j’ai compris que pour
Retoucher mon nuage
J’pouvais juste être la star
D’une ligue de garage

Fa’ que le mercredi soir
Quand je saute sur la glace qui reluit
Chu un p’tit gars
Chu Wayne Gretzky

On n’oublie jamais
Ses rêves de ti-cul
Dès qu’mon gars est assez vieux
J’l’emmène jouer au hockey dans’ rueWanna be with you, in everything I do, 
I wanna see you, every day and night, 
When I was so lonely, I felt this strong desire to love, 
But it went too quickly, and now I'm burning - hot, 
And now I'm burning hot... 

I wanna be with you, 
In everything I do, 
I wanna see you, 
Every day and night... 

Can't get enough of you, 
You make the day go through, 
And everything right now, 
Just seems so right... 

When I was oh so lonely, 
I felt the strong desire to love, 
Everything's gone too quickly, 
'Cause now I'm burning hot... 

May Day - I'm falling in love again... 
May Day - I'm falling in love... 
May Day - I'm falling in love again... 
Once more - the dangerous game... 

Remember every time, 
I feel I lose my mind, 
With hot emotions, 
I might lose control... 

The passion is so strong, 
And something can go wrong, 
But risky business, 
Can well be my goal... 

I can be sad or happy, 
And that's the danger of your love, 
I can just hope I'm lucky, 
'Cause it's too late to stop... 


He left me this morning, midnight was turning day

And my will to kill
You will kill for me

All that I desire
All that I command
You are here for me
I'm your master

My creation

I will make for you
A soul mate to love
Unlike your love for me
And you will take my name

She will be your bride
She will serve me too
And I will introduce you to
The Bride of FrankensteinA, yeah yeah

And gettin' nowhere (nowhere)

Who really cares

Before you call him a man?

I had to run away, and get down on my knees and pray that they'd go away
But still they'd begin, needles and pins 
Because of all my pride, the tears I gotta hide

Hey I thought I was smart, I'd won her heart
Didn't think I'd do, but now I see
She's worse to him than me, let her go ahead
Take his love instead, and one day she will see
Just how to say please, and get down on her knees
Hey that's how it begins, she'll feel those needles and pins
A-hurtin' her, a-hurtin' her

Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong
Why can't I stand up and tell myself I'm strong

Tell me you never wanted more than this
And I will stop talking now
One perfect partner, one eternal kiss
Whoa

Take back the city for yourself tonight
Or I'll take back the city for me
Take back the city for yourself tonight
Whoa

It's a mess, it's a start
It's a flawed work of art
Your city, your call
Every crack, every wall
Pick a side, pick a fight
Get your epitaph right
You can sing, 'til you drop
Cause the fun just never stops

I love this city tonight
I love this city always
It bears it's teeth like a light
And spits me out after day's
But we're all gluttons for it
We know what's wrong and it's right
For every time it's been hit
Take back the city tonight

I love this city tonight
I love this city always
It bears it's teeth like a light

La-de-dooYou told me baby, once upon a time
You said if I would be yours, you would sure be mine
That's alright
I know you don't love me no more baby, but that's alright
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight

You told me baby, your love for me was strong
When I woke up little girl, half of this big world was gone
That's alright
I guess I'll never be the same but that's alright
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight

(spoken: Play the blues for me Freddie King!)

Please tell me baby, what's getting wrong with you?
You don't treat me halfway right baby, look a like you used to do
But that's alright

He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day

And he tells me all my charms

How many ways can you say that I love you forever more
How many times can you make love with your lover
How many lives and many lies can we live with ourselves

How many times will you change your religion
And how many gods do you ask for the answers that grow when you're sad
What has to break before you make a decision
'Cause you never know which way to go, you just get off the bus and go home

God, tell me the truth, how much is too many
Give me a sign if we crossed the line
'Cause everyone else seems to know the direction

How many dreams can you break 'till you're broken'

Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there alright
But they all go native on a Saturday Night

Their music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellah packs a gun
Ev'rybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

Well, now you've heard my story 'bout a place I know

In my arms
She said she would always stay
But I was cruel
And I treated her like a fool
I threw it all away

Once I had mountains
In the palm of my hand
And rivers to drink through everyday
But I must have been mad
I never knew what I had
Until I threw it all away

That makes the world go round
Love as only love
Can't be denied

Not matter what you think about it
Just won't be able to do without it

So when you find someone
Who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart don't
Let is stray
'Cause one thing for certain
You will surely be hurting
If you throw it all away

Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Livin' in a cottage made of earth and wood,
Lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell.

Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, strummin' his guitar in the gentle shade,
Playing to the music that the drivers made.
People passing by they'd stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode

His mama told him ?someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
All kinds a people coming from miles around
To hear ya play ya guitar 'till the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.

Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. GoodeI'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you're starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line
Right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, hey

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line
Right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over

Anybody can find someone

To rev ?em up and turn ?em on

And baby it?s a lot of fun but then what

When a little time has past

You take off your Mardi Gras mask

That?s when you know if you really have the right stuff


Truly true love

It?s full on fightin? then kissin? all night even though I know I?m right and you?re wrong

Truly true love

Baby it?s the glue keeping me and you holding onto what we know that we couldn?t do on our own

Making love when we first wake up

That?s the icing on the cake but

Seeing me without my make- up

That?s truly truly


We?ve been down and up and down

Thought of throwing in the towel

And we?re far from perfect now but so what

?Cause it?s about the ride we take

And the memories we make

And the way the earth still quakes when we touch



Truly true love

It?s full on fightin? then kissin? all night even though I know I?m right and you?re wrong

Truly true love

Baby it?s the glue keeping me and you holding onto what we know that we couldn?t do on our own

Making love when we first wake up

That?s the icing on the cake but

Seeing me without my make- up

That?s truly true love

Well boy it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You shoulda seen their faces when they seen how I grown
In them old cotton fields back homeRain pours down over a city
Night has fallen like a stone
Are you gone or are you with me?
In my heart I'll never know
If I close my eyes I'll see you
Hear your footsteps in the rain
In my dream I'll never find you
but I'll hear you call my name

As I tread through crowds of people
Trying to keep from looking back
Got your sense on something passing
And it sends me off my track

Do I find you will I follow
To forever and a day
I can feel you in the distance
But you seem so far away

What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
What about all the things I just don't don't know (ooh)
What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
Would you be there to show me where to go (ooh)I am the horseman
I'm mentally mad
I am a super-sharp shooter
Sittin' on a rooftop

Through the texture
Come and get a taste of the fixture

Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries "Nay! Nay!" to me
And people declare "You're through!",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.I don't wanna see you ever sad
And ev'rything that I've got, you can have.
When it's all too much 
You need some human touch
To see it's really not so bad.
 
Did you call on ev'ry saint you know,
But still you feel like you're on you own?
Can you see through your tears?
I will always be here.
You're not out there, baby all alone.
 
Hold on.
Do you feel a little stronger?
Hold on to me.
Yeah, and I said, hold on. 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright,
Just hold on to me tonight.
 
Anything that hurts you, hurts me too,
And I'm not gonna let your world turn blue.
Will you take my hand and feel how close I am?
There ain't nothing I won't do for you.
 
Hold on.
Do you feel a little stronger?
Hold on to me.
Yeah, and I said, hold on. 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright,
Just hold on to me tonight.
 
I know the world can drive you to your knees.
When you need to cry, baby, cry to me, yeah.
 
Yeah, now hold on.
Do you feel a little stronger?
Hold on to me.
Yeah. I said hold on.
Ev'rything's gonna be alright,
Just hold on to me tonight.Everybody run, everybody knows,
Everybody pull the gun, everybody rolls,
Everybody skip, everybody choose,
Everybody sticks and everybody loose,
Everybodys favours, everybody waits,
Everybodys gorgeous and everybody fakes,
Everybodys screaming, everybodys blind,
Everybody could be dying, anybody fine.

Is this a mirror of myself,
Am I somebody else,
I don't wanna be...everybody!

Everybody..

Everybody run,everybody knows,
Everybody pulls the gun, everybody rolls,
Everybody skips, everybody choose,

Everybodys bonking unless everybodys paid

These are the postcards from a young man
They may never be written or posted again

It is like so many other things
As distant as your former sins
So sad and lonely and so derelict
As the optimism that we once shared

These are the postcards from a young man
They may never be written or posted again
These are the postcards from a young man
They may never be written or posted again

I'll send you postcards every single day
Just to prove I still exist
This world will not impose its will
I will not give up and I will not give in
And I will not give up and I will not give in

I won't betray your confidence
I won't pretend my way was lost
This world will not impose its will
I will not give up and I will not give inMy love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you(Lotzsch , Vollbehr , Schluter , Liebschner , Solterbeck)

That most important reindeer of all?
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They wouldn't let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
But then one foggy Christmas Eve

Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history."

In the darkness

There is no sound
It's so tranquil
It's so calm like you
But now I hear a noise
Is there any way to out of this nightmare?
Baby, I'm alone now
And you're laughing at me
But I take life
In a way that you could never see
So if you're leaving
You better let me know
'Cause I've already started my plan
And I'm never gonna let you go
I've lived on the dark side of the moon
And I've been to the heart of the sun
I've had my time with many ladies
And I've killed many men
Before my sixteenth year was done
So you be forewarned
I'm coming after you
About the time I catch up to you

Cherish the light for us,
Don't let the shadows hold back the dawn.

Cold city lights glowing,
The traffic of life is flowing,
Out over the rivers and on into dark.

I'm going down town where there's music,
I'm going where voices fill the air,
Maybe there's someone waiting for me
With a smile and a flower in her hair

I'm going down town where there's people
The loneliness hangs in the air.
With no-one there real waiting for me,
No smile, no flower nowhere.

In rocky cathedrals that reach to the sky

And all of those who see me, all who believe in me
Share in the freedom I feel when I fly
 
Come dance with the west wind and touch on the mountain tops
Sail over the canyons and up to the stars
And reach for the heavens and hope for the future
And all that we can be and not what we areTurning out, beggars to eat me
Cutting wood, coming to lure us.
Beggars watch to pull you in.
Lure them back in front of you.
Eat it up and spit it out.
What you saw is sweet nothing.
Coming to lure you in.
For twenty-four, twenty-four, twenty-four hours a day.

Eat it up and spit it out.
Too slim to aspire to.
Pick it 'till you bleed, turn back.
Cutting wood, coming to lure us, in.

Coming to lure us in.

Turning back, they break us 'till we bleed.
Cutting wood. Coming to lure us, in.
Make us watch them pull you in.
Throw it back in front of you.
Eat it up and spit it out.
What we saw that's in our face.
To satisfy, to make us, to make us, 'till we bleed.
Twenty-four, twenty-four, twenty-four hours a day.

Twenty-four, twenty-four, twenty-four hours a day.

Kick us 'til we wait to lure us.
Make us watch
Throw it back in front of you.
Eat it up and spit it out.
What we saw that's in our face.
For twenty-four, twenty-four, twenty-four hours a day.

Eat it up and spit it out.
When we saw the shape of things to satisfy our makers.
Makers 'till we bleed.
Twenty-four, twenty-four, twenty-four hours a day.

Twenty-four, twenty-four, twenty-four hours a day.
Twenty-four, twenty-four, twenty-four hours a day.

Turning, turning. Other smells you take it off.
Underground you hear our feet.
Turning, you spit it out.
Coming to lure us in.

Twenty-four, twenty-four, twenty-four hours a day.Sick jack:

Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope
That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?Para componer un son

I remember this moment, years ago there was only you and me
When I wake up in sadness I realize my deep wounds never heal 
Living only in memories, all is lost, coldness I can feel

Sky turned darker and darker, soulless voices whispering her name 
End came closer and closer, endless sleep was sweeping in her veins

She faded away like a rose on a Winter day
I remember her last words, please don't cry for me

Lost in endless night, take me there, where I see you again
Reach out for the light, when will I break my pain
Come and fly with me all across the raging sea 
Together we will be, when will I ever be free

One night I was dreaming, seemed to me like reality, so clear
A fallen angel inside me, speaks to me, tells me what has to be done
There's a fire in my heart burning bright like the glory of a king
For too long I was waiting, now my soul is flowing in the wind

Bright lights streaming faster
At night in the motel I dream of the car
Crashing through the wild pastures

Is there much further now?
Are you loosing the meaning?

Insects and moths spiral lost in the headlights
They're fragile disasters
Is this the year when we lose our direction?
Is time flying past us?

Is there much further now?
Are you loosing the meaning?

Counting the miles between every sign
There must be something out here to find
Follow me on and drive through the night
Follow me back into the daylight

Cumulus clouds always towering higher
I'm harbouring feelings
Every place hides a life we could make
If we started believing

Is there much further now?
Are you losing the meaning?

Counting the miles between every sign
There must be something out here to find
Follow me on and drive through the night
Follow me back into the daylightOh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away you roam
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home

I met a man who lives in Tennessee
And he was headin' for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
From Pennsylvania folks are trav'lin' down
To Dixie's sunny shore
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee,
The traffic is terrific!

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away you roam
If you want to be happy in a million ways
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet homeGood sister, won't you let me in?

I throw myself into the arms of mercy

My good father, he say to me
Better come back to your senses
There's an empty bottle lying on the floor
And it's undermined your defences

Gorgeous and dressed in blue
I know it drives you crazy
When I pretend you don't exist
When I'd like to lean in close
And run my hands against your lips
Though we haven't even spoken
Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Don't worry I'm not looking at you 
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
I know you see me see you
As you see me walk on past
When there's nothing more I'd like to do
Then come in close and hear you laugh
Though we haven't even spoken
Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Yea whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Hmm whisper me your number

'Cause I've seen how it aches when you've missed your chance, 
The time's gone, 

Snap decisions cause you so much pain
Then you come 'round again and there's nothing left at all
Perfect vision, now I'm running blind
Too scared of what I'll find when you call 

Only now I've let go
Honey, I just don't know
Sit right here and watch the sky above for a sign
Tell me will you miss me, when I'm in your history
Baby, there ain't nothing good about this goodbye 

If you are the one
This regret will last forever
'Cause nobody knows if we should stay together 

Snap decisions cause you so much pain, 
Then you come round again and there's nothing left at all, 
Selfish, but I think its for the best
I'll miss you for the rest of my life 

Only now I've let go
Honey, I just don't know

AahWelcome to my world
Won't you come on in?
Miracles, I guess
Still happen now and then

Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind

Knock and the door will open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this world of mine

I'll be waiting here
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world

Waiting just for you
Welcome to my worldFrom lands across the sea we have returned once more
With countless treasures plundered from those distant shores
But now the time has come, our destiny at hand
With cannonfire and battlecry we will reclaim this land

Misery and slaughter we left burning in our wake
A legacy of torment is rightfully ours to take

We sail the endless oceans
We sail the raging seas
The quest is never ending
It leads us to destiny

The endless quest is calling us another time
The jolly roger in the sky is our sign
The mountains shook, the seas began to boil
As we set out again to conquer foreign soil

Misery and slaughter we left burning in our wake
A legacy of torment is rightfully ours to take

We sail the endless oceans
We sail the raging seas
The quest is never ending
It leads us to destinyWell I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has gotta body like me

But I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh, but I need some time off
From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When that love comes down

Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showin' you that door
Well I gotta have faith

Got to have faith [Repeat: x3]

Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say please, please, please don't go away
'Cause you're givin' me the blues
Maybe, you might mean all the words you say

Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to the lover boy blues
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you pick my heart up off the floor

When our love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you that door
Well I gotta have faith

Gotta have faith [Repeat: x3]
Get the f*ck up!
Well I gotta have faith

Gotta have faith [Repeat: x4]Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock

Merry christmas, happy holidays
Merry christmas, happy holidays

How's that for a Christmas song?Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the starsLove, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atoneWhenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries "Nay! Nay!" to me
And people declare "You're through!",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.You're no bold villain
You're bought and sold
To have a soulmate
You need a soul

Not born of men
But some bog-mother moon
One of us is not normal
And it might not be you

I was a spook for you
Another ghoul 
I was a fool for you
Another stool pigeon

I was the kid
See she was the clown
And you took north
When things went south

But you're no bold villain
You're bought and sold
To have a soulmate
You need a soul

Not born of men
But some bog-mother moon
One of us is not normal

Il a le sourire facile, même pour les imbéciles
Il s'amuse bien, il n'tombe jamais dans les pièges
Il n'se laisse pas étourdir par les néons des manèges
Il vit sa vie sans s'occuper des grimaces
Que font autour de lui les poissons dans la nasse

Il est libre Max
Il est libre Max!
Y en a même qui disent qu'ils l'ont vu voler

Il travaille un p'tit peu quand son corps est d'accord

Il n'cherche pas à tout prix à faire des bulles dans la mare

Et bien sûr toutes les filles lui font leurs yeux de velours

Chevaucher les licornes à la tombée du soir

Il est libre Max

Y en a même qui disent qu'ils l'ont vu voler

Comme il n'a pas d'argent pour faire le grand voyageur

I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said "You're on buddy -- my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way -- to Dead Man's Curve"

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
(Dead Man's Curve) you'd best keep away
(Dead Man's Curve) I can hear 'em say
"Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve"

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine!

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six taillights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were - at Dead Man's Curve

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
(Dead Man's Curve...  )

"Well, the last thing I remember, Doc
I started to swerve
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
I guess I found out for myself that everyone was right"

Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
(Dead Man's Curve) you'd best keep away

Making friends with a homeless torn up man

There's danger on, every corner but I'm okay
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

Tried to get a break
But the boss said 'No dice, son,
You gotta work late'

Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well, my Mom and Poppa told me
Son, you gotta earn some money
If you want to use the care
To go riding next Sunday
Well, I wouldn't go to work
I told the boss I was sick
He said 'You can't use the car
'Cause you didn't work a lick'

Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Gonna take two weeks
Gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problem
To the United Nations
Well' I went to my congressman
He said 'quote'
'I'd like to help you son,
But you're too young to vote'

Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues[Repeat: x6]
Feeling like I want some more

[Chorus]
You got me open like a liquor store 
Love so strong that I don't want no more
I can't describe the way you got me shook
You're like a drug girl you got me hooked
You're the queen I see in my dreams
Want to taste some of your ice cream
I can't describe the way you got me shook
You're like a drug girl you got me hooked

My boys say I'm tripping but I'm like so 
'cause you got me open I don't care who knows
When it comes to you baby anything goes
You're just like that drug that they smoke 
You got my mind twisted and all tied up
From your conversation and gentle touch 
Whatever you want baby never too much
Baby sit back and let me take a puff

[Chorus]

Damn girl
You got me hooked hooked hooked
Girl you know you got me hooked hooked hooked
You got me hooked hooked hooked

'Cause when you're with me its like a natural high
Just like Marvin Gaye touching his keyboard
When you touch me it makes me say oh lord
Girl you got every little bit of my soul
Making it hard for me to gain control 
Even when I try to tell myself no
There's a little voice saying one more

Lookin' for you

I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing, I wouldn't give
From this moment on

You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing, I wouldn't give
From this moment, I will love you
As long as I live from this moment onLong ago in days untold 
Were ruled by lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold they dared
To bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines 
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws 
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive
Oh I know I 
Lived this life afore
Somehow I know now 
Truths I must be sure
Tossin', turnin', nightmares burnin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships, the Viking spits
The blood of father's land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death, fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die
Screams of no reply
They died
Screams of no reply
And died
Died
Lordy, Lordy, they diedIn the middle of the night 
Six strings down 
On the heaven-bound flight 
Got a pick, a strap, guitar on his back

Back homeI used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like youWhen I lost my way home
I was helpless
Like a small child
No eyes of my own
That could take me through the nighttime
No moonlight to guide me
No shadow to hide me
There in the dark
I found Sun Mountain
I once had a friend
Tried to help me
In a bad way
When I got to the end
Of a long and lonely highway
Strung out and down-hearted
Right back where I started
There in the dark
I found Sun Mountain
Here in my world
I remember
All the things I left behind
And if I need them
They will be there
A part of my mind
It's only a house
And the rooftop
Is the blue sky
No windows or walls
And the days or years pass by 
I slept through the daylight
I woke up, it was midnight
There in the dark
I found Sun MountainDriving down those city streets
Waiting to get down
Won't you get your big machine
Somewhere in this town?

Now in the parking lot garage
You'll find the proper place
Just follow all the written rules
You'll fit into the space

Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine
Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between

Pull up
To it
Don't drive
Through it

Back it
Up twice
Now that
Fit's nice

Operate around the clock
Why don't you come in?
I've got lot's of space for everyone
Why don't you my friend?

Lines are short
I'll pick you up so won't you please come on
Shiny sleek machine believe
It I've got to blow your horn

Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine
Just pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between

Falling in time

I can't get it out of me
It's breathing in side of me
It's reaching in side of you
You feeling infected
You been infected
It's just like a cold
A kiss on your lips
Now you taking control
I feel like a criminal
I'm falling apart
I'm leaving for Venice
In a getaway car
No one can save us
It's no need to try
I'm looking for savers
Holding us back

If you wanna try and save me
And take my heart and take me
If you feel you can let go let it go, let go, let go

I feel like a criminal
I'm falling apart
I'm leaving for Venice
In a getaway car
You say that you hold me
But you don't really no
You clinging to fingers , but you gotta let go 

If you wanna try and save me
And take my heart and take me
If you feel you can let go let it go , let go, let go

(Let go, let go, let go, let go.)

If you wanna try and save me
And take my heart and take me
If you feel you can let go let it goOh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!Sometimes the only thing that saves you
Think of bad things luck never gave you
And although your true love has just left you
Well at least your mother kept you, yes she did
Be sure that a dreams alive
They're only short bursts in life
Are you able to be satisfied
Do expect fun all the time

Hey we can rock it easy and lay it in the fold
Hey we can shake you simply just by being cold
And if it falls apart will you still be my friend
Get back, we're gonna stick together

And so many things that have gone wrong
At least you have ears to hear this song
And if you reading in close caption
There's still bad things that could have happened, yes there is
Long time since we've first came here
Sometimes we fall on deaf ears
One thing I got to say before sales dive
Stay positive and love your life

Hey we can rock it easy and lay it in the fold
Hey we can shake you simply just by being cold
And if it falls apart will you still be my friend
Get back, we're gonna stick together, uhDidn't he ramble, he rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble
He rambled till the butcher cut him down

His feet was in the market place, his head was in the street
Lady pass him by, said, look at the market meat
He grabbed her pocket book, and said I wish you well
She pulled out a forty-five, said I'm head of personnel

Didn't he ramble, I said he rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
Didn't he ramble, oh didn't he ramble
He rambled till the butcher shot him down

He slipped into the cat house, made love to the stable
Madam caught him cold, said I'll pay you when I be able
Six months had passed, and she stood all she could stand
She said buddy when I'm through with you
Ole groundhog gonna be shakin yo' hand

And didn't he ramble, he rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
Oh didn't he ramble, he rambled
You know he rambled 'til the butcher cut him down

I said he rambled lord 'til the butcher shot him downI hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I dieThis Romeo is bleeding, but you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up

Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well,I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

Yeah I, will love you, baby
Always and I'll be there
Forever and a day, always

I'll be there, till the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die you'll be on my mind 
And I'll love you, always

Now your picture's that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh
Some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye

What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
Touch your lips, to hold you near,
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words
You've been needing to hear, I'll wish I was him
'Cause these words are mine, to say to you
'Til the end of time 

Yeah I, will love you, baby
Always and I'll be there
Forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice
But baby, if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams, and our old lives, 
We'll find a place, where the sun still shines

Yeah I, will love you, baby
Always and I'll be there
Forever and a day, always

I'll be there, till the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die you'll be on my mind 
And I'll love you, always
AlwaysBúscame en el fondo de la noche que siempre voy a estar esperándote
Tirame un anzuelo para ver si salimos de una vez de aquí

Que por la boca muere el pez pues por la boca comenzamos
Y si tu tienes que beber de mi que sea de mi de mi de mi

Humilde tiburón para endulzar mi vodka en el bar
Y bailo en altamar encendieron las luces del lugar
Y es hora de sarpar

Que por la boca muere el pez, pues por la boca comenzamos
Y si tu tienes que beber que sea de mi, de mi, de mi

Y un beso camicas casi casi casi casi logra despegar
Y estrellarse en ti y hundirte la boca en la calle
Que viste de luces y erupta espuma del mar en el bar
Para sumergirnos en su remolino

Que por la boca muere el pez pues por la boca comenzamos
Y si tu tienes que beber que sea de mi, de mi, de mi, de mi

Al despertarnos en esa nausea en tu mirar en tu mirar
Te vistes siempre de mi de mi de mi de mi

Lately things just don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Am I happy or in misery?

You're makin' me blow my mind...mama
Purple haze, n-no, nooo
Purple haze, no, its painful, babyHow did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Chorus
Be like a child
Welcome each day
And, don't loose yourselfHey pretty baby are you ready for me
It's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee
I'm just out of Austin bound for San Antone
With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on

There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town
But no local yokel gonna shut me down
'Cause me and my boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town

Nothin' ever happened 'round my hometown
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone callin' my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway

Everybody told me you can't get far
On thirty-seven dollars and a jap guitar
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rockin' little combo from the Guitar Town

Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault
I love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant wonderin' why I don't stop

Gotta keep rockin' why I still can
I gotta two pack habit and a motel tan
But when my boots hit the boards I'm a brand new man
With my back to the riser I make my stand

And hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight
We're loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
And take you back with me to the Guitar TownIl avait de grands yeux très clairs
Où parfois passaient des éclairs
Comme au ciel passent des orages
Il avait plein de tatouages

Que j'ai jamais très bien compris
Son cou portait, "pas vu, pas pris"
Sur son cœur on lisait, "personne"
Sur son bras droit un mot, "raisonne"

Je sais pas son nom, je ne sais rien de lui
Il m'a aimée toute la nuit
Mon légionnaire
Et me laissant à mon destin

Il est parti dans le matin
Plein de lumière!
Il était mince, il était beau
Il sentait bon le sable chaud

Mon légionnaire!
Y avait du soleil sur son front
Qui mettait dans ses cheveux blonds
De la lumière!

Bonheur perdu, bonheur enfui
Toujours je pense à cette nuit
Et l'envie de sa peau me ronge
Parfois je pleure et puis je songe

Que lorsqu'il était sur son cœur
J'aurais dû crier mon bonheur
Mais je n'ai rien osé lui dire
J'avais peur de le voir sourire!

Je sais pas son nom, je ne sais rien de lui

On l'a trouvé dans le désert
Il avait ses beaux yeux ouverts
Dans le ciel passaient des nuages
Il a montré ses tatouages

En souriant puis il a dit
Montrant son cou, "pas vu, pas pris"
Montrant son cœur, "ici personne"
Il ne savait pas, je lui pardonne

Je rêvais pourtant que le destin
Me ramènerait un beau matin
Mon légionnaire

Qu'on s'en irait loin, tous les deux
Dans quelque pays merveilleux
Plein de lumière

Something in the way she moves 
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
All I gotta do is think of her
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will our love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus]

You're asking me will our love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus]People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up

I wear since my break up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tearsSome say, death is the easy way
And I think they're right
'Cause nights tick, by like a long week
Except when you stop by
And I know that tryin' gets nothing done
And I see you're about dry

'Cause nothin' gets you high
You're poor the day you die
And alcohol it only makes you tired
But seein' you feels good
And it's always understood
That anything much sweeter
Would make me dieOnce upon a time
No more words to say
Find me in the circle
Find me in the end

I am the soul collector
Dressed in ebony
There are no rules
But only one

There's someone young sister,
Caught at the border
Let's get in contact
He's either yours or mine

I have thought
That this will never end
And things go on
But nothing will last
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it
In distant shores of green
It's over now

Far out in space
I ride on
Time is chasing us all
It's not quite how it seems
It's just a dream

I don't believe
In a soul or in god

It's just twisted
Further
You do not understand:

Each single breath inspires you
Come to an end - expire

Rise up my sister
Let's cross the border
Reveal the secret
One more to burn

I have thought
That this will never end
And things go on
But nothing will last
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it
In distant shores of green
It's over now

You finally have approached
Still
There is something left to do:
Draw me and prove
Your souls not ripe, yet!
Prepare yourself then wait for me
Expect the day when I come by
You're released now
For a while you may feel
Resurrection
Open your eyes

The vision's bleak 
And the color is black
Far Beyond
There's a starving
But dying sun

I have thought
That this will never end
And things go on
But nothing will last
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it
In distant shores of green
It's over nowRemember those walls I built
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo

Halo, halo

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face

Our parents had been friends for years
Almost every afternoon we'd play forbidden games
At nine years old there's no such thing as shame

It wasn't recognition of her face, what
Brought me back was a familiar mark
As it flashed across the screen. I
Bought some magazines, some video taped scenes
Incriminating act I felt that I could save her

Who the hell are you to tell me how to live my life?
You think I sell my body; I merely sell my time
I ain't no Cinderella, I ain't waiting for no prince
To save me in fact until just now I was doin' just fine
And on and on

I know what degradation feels like
I felt it on the floor of the factory
Where I worked long before, I took control
Now I answer to me
The 50K I make this year will go anywhere I please
Where's the problem?Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!Seen the world
It's crumbling all around me
A place to go
Where I felt safe
In search of help
I fell down on my knees
I pray to lord
Please keep my way

Doors open I've never know
When I ask faith
He'll show me which way to go

When the road gets rough
I've got to stand
Or else I'll fall
In God's creation
I know where I stand

Temptation sings
Its songs are loud and clear
But I won't let my feet stray from this path
Not even for all my heart
I know, I know, I know my mission
Is to walk as light as I can
To keep you looking up
When I'm feeling down
Keep my feet on the ground 
Take it step by step and 

He'll show me which way to go
My age combines wisdom
Nor sliver of gold

When the road gets rough
I've got to stand
Or else I'll fall
In God's creation
I know where I stand

He'll show me which way to go
My age combines wisdom
Nor sliver of gold

When the road gets rough
I've got to stand
Or else I'll fall
In God's creation
I know where my salvation lies
I know, I know, I know
In God's creation 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
There are some things
That I may not know
Sometimes the hills are hard
Are hard to climb
But I know, I know, I know
Someone who has the plan

When the road gets rough
I've got to stand
Or else I'll fall
In God's creation
I know where I standPara hacer esta muralla

My friends I stand before you
To tell a truth most dire
They lust a traitor in our midst
Who haven't vote the captain's ire

He don't deserve no mercy
We ought to shoot him with a gun
But I am not an evil man
So first let's have a little fun

We'll tie that scoundrel to a rope
And throw it overboard
Drag him underneath the ship
A terrifying deadly trip

Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho

Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho

I will not say what he has done
His sins are far to grave to tell
It's not my place to judge a man
But boy he will burn in hell

The sharks will dine up on his flesh
And davie jones will have his soul
Take his money and his hat
He won't need them where he's gonna go

And first lets tie him to a rope
And throw him overboard
Drag him underneath the ship
A terrifying deadly trip

É um pingo pingando, é uma conta, é um ponto
É um peixe, é um gesto, é uma prata brilhando

Three nights at the motel

Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna
Stay up tonight
Stay up at night
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little
Company from me
But if you got everything
Figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute
Don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time
For you (ou), to (oo)

And you can call me names if you call me up

I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures
From her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved
She stopped returnin' my calls
Flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too fucked on and over both ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay
Or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music watchin' movies
Talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head
Just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money
Maybe someday you could take it from me
I'm up too late
Thinkin' bout you

It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel OK

When I'm home everything seems to be right

Oh now

She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress hotter than the heat in July
With her wind blown hair it just wasn't fair the way she was blowing my mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane gets it's name from a girl like this
She's the cat fight kind keeps you up at night hanging on to the edge of a kiss
She's a beautiful mess, yeah the kind you love to love
But what happens next,
I got a feeling when the sun comes up

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up, little leap-way, little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels somewhere between going and gone
You get so lost that you can't turn it off, you give in and you just turn it on
She's a harp on a reign red lips like a flame, she's the girl from your favorite song
What a beautiful mess,
A one part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
The kind of flood you'll never forget

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up, little leap-way little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
Yeah, I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a sign, or storm warning, yeah

A little heads up, little more time, little leap-way some kind of sign
Would have been nice
Some kind of radar system, if I heard it yeah I would have listened
To the storm, to the storm warningJohnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire, his fate was sealed
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars, it was no big deal
Rosa had streets
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown, Johnny better run, better run
 
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire
 
The ride was over but the story doesn't end, he took her heart
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start
The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone, it was on the street
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
Johnny better run, better run
 
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire
 
Johnny's holdin' Rosa on a rooftop in the night, as time stood still
They couldn't hear him coming 'til he had them both in sight
You could feel a chill
A shot ran out like thunder and the blood was on her hands, with nothing won
When someone lies dying, lovers finally understand
 
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fireUh, I feel that this has given me the most incredible 
And wonderful thing
That I have ever been given, and also, the worst. 
It's a mixed bag, uh, I
Have been taken to the, absolutely, 
To the depths of extreme terror by this.
I've had my whole soul undermined by it, 
On the one hand. 
On the other hand,

Pick so much artist and still nuh choose one 
Wait till mi hold in mi divan 
Cecile yuh file wrong, read back yuh application 
Badman nah run from woman fi get slam 
Pick so much artist and still nuh choose one 
Who yuh are Lady G or Lady Ann???And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.Stone by stone, heart by heart
You're tearin' my world, and all my dreams apart
On your own, you're doing it stone by stone

Brick by brick, tear by tear
The love we made has slowly disappeared
It's as good as gone, you're takin' it stone by stone

Why can't you up and just walk away
Do you have to drag it out day after day
I'm tired of tryin', I'm giving up
You tear it down faster than I can pick it up

Room by room, wall by wall
Pretty soon it's gonna fall
Wrecking this home
Doin' it stone by stone

Why can't you up and just walk away
Do you have to drag it out day after day
I'm tired of tryin', I'm giving up
You tear it down faster than I can pick it up

Stone by stone, heart by heart
You're tearin' my world, and all my dreams apart
On your own, you're doin' it stone by stone

Stone by stone by stone by stone
Stone by stone by stone by stone
On your own, you're doin' it stone by stone
I'm through with love, 
I'll never fall again, 
Said adieu to love, 
Don't ever call again, 
For I must have you or no one, 
That's why I'm through with love. 

I've locked my heart, 
I keep my feelings there. 
I have stocked my heart like an icy Frigidaire, 
For I need to care for no one, 
That's why I'm through with love. 

Why did you lead me to think that you cared? 
You didn't need me, 
For you had your share 
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear, 
Their deep devotion emotion, to you

Goodbye to spring, 
And all it meant to me, 
It could never bring the things that used to be, 
For I must have you or no one, 
That's why I'm through with love.
That's why I'm through with love

Goodbye to spring, 
And all it meant to me, 
It could never bring the things that used to be, 
For I must have you or no one, 
And so I'm through with love.Oye el boom boom de mi corazon
Ven y dime tu no me digas no ay
Que me derrito por caer
Rodando cuesta abajo
Al abismo de tu piel ay
Que me estoy muriendo poco a poco
Mirarte y no tenerte
Me está volviendo loco
Dónde estás?
Tan solo dame un poco mas
De la miel que me envenena de pasión
Oye el boom boom boom de mi corazon
Ven y dime tú no me digas no
Porque ya no aguanto mas por ti me estoy muriendo
Oye el boom boom boom de mi corazón
Bajare la luna por tu balcon
Solo ven y dame mas
De lo que llevas dentro

Ay, eres pecado y es mortal pero morir no importa
Si te veo al despertar
Ay, demasiado fuego para andar
Pidiendo dar batalla
Y yo a punto de estallar
Donde estas?
Tan solo dame un poco mas de la miel que me envenena
De pasion 
Oye el boom boom boom de mi corazon
Ven y dime tu no me digas no
Porque ya no aguanto mas
Por ti me estoy muriendo
Oye el boom boom boom de mi corazon 
Bajare la luna por tu balcon, solo ven y dame mas
De lo que llevas dentro
Al menos dame una mirada
Una señal, una palabra
Tu sabes bien que donde estes
Aqui te espero

Y ya no hay noche sin tus ojos
Y ya no hay fuerza sin tus besos
Y nada soy sin el perfume de tu amor
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Late mi corazon, cada vez que siento
Que solo quiero ser el dueño de tu amor
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Late mi corazon, cada vez que siento
Que solo quiero ser el dueño de tu amor
Oye el boom boom boom de mi corazon

Por que no aguanto, no aguanto el amor, que me estoy muriendo
Boom boom boom, oh yeah, boom boom boom, oh yeah
Solo dame mas del amor que llevas dentro

Ven y dime tu no me digas no
Oye el boom boom boom de mi corazon
Bajare la luna por tu balcon
Solo ven y dame mas
De lo que llevas dentro
Fiesta fiesta jijji taniThere was a time when I thought of no other and we sang our own love's refrain
Our hearts beat as one as we had our fun but time changes everything
When you left me my poor heart was broken our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again for time changes everything

[ fiddle - steel ]

You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything
So good luck to you may God bless you I can't say I won't love again
You've gone your way and now I'll go mine cause time has changed everythingI just wanna
Show you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin' good

Wanna show you how much, I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe
Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo heart
I wanna show ya how much, I hate being apart
Show ya, show ya, show ya til you're through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body 
Promise not to tell nobody 'cause

You'll never need two, 'cause I will be your number 1

But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backin' this thing back
Pop poppin' this thing back
Drop drop drop dropping this thing back
This is for the time, you gave me flowers
For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won't never ever eh-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it's the pre game show
Daddy you know what's up

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

[Chorus]

I'mma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe 
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rockin' on you babe
Rockin' rockin' on you babe
Swirlin' on you babe
In my mind all I can think about 
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last

[Chorus]We're moving higher to our promise, our destiny
No one can hinder what the Lord God has stored for me
His promises are sure, don't give up, you must endure
Keep reaching and believe the kingdom is yours for sure

I'm pressed toward the mark of the high calling in Jesus' name
Surely goodness and mercy shall take me higher

Let's go higher, higher, higher, let's go higher, higher in God (level next)
Let's go higher, higher, higher, let's go higher, higher in God

We're moving higher to our promise, our destiny

Surely goodness and mercy shall take me higher

Let's go higher, higher, higher, let's go higher, higher in God (level next)
Let's go higher, higher, higher, let's go higher, higher in GodKeep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in, again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense

Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never-ending, never-ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

In time our soul untold
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent
We're temporary, temporary
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirrored in your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that will take you down
Bring you to your knees

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

What if I say I'm not like the others?

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?All our tears have reached the sea
Part of you will live in me
Way down deep inside my heart
The days keep coming without fail
New wind is gonna find your sail
That's where your journey starts

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Just like the waves down by the shore
We're gonna keep on comin' back for more
'Cause we don't ever want to stop
Out in this brave new world you'll see
Ov'r the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Remember me when you're out walking
When snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor
And I can't hurt you anymore

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Please remember meWhat was I supposed to do? 
I turned around with the world and she simply was there 
My blood ran like ice right through 
She had your face and your lips 
And your eyes and your hair 

You're the wish you are I had 
You're the wish you are I had 
You're the wish that I had 

I wonder if she knows that when I made her up 
I made her eat an apple 
And I made her drink a cup or two 

Wish wish wish wish wish 
Wish wish wish wish wish for you 

Who'd believe me if I said 
I brought an angel to earth by the power of mind 
Think I'm going off my head 
She caught the same bus as me and she sat down behind 

You're the wish you are I had 
You're the wish you are I had 
You're the wish that I had 

Little did I know that on a rainy day 
All the little wishes I had put away 
Would bring you 

Wish wish wish wish wish 
Wish wish wish wish wish for you 

Well if wishing is bad bad bad 
Then send me to hell hell hell 
But If you take my wish away 
Then this cold world would burn as well

The pictures remind me the story fills the page
I think of all the day's limelight and self-decay
My suitcase gets weaker my voice sure needs a breakIt's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

They're only made of clay

Alright, look
I seen these guys backstage, I'm gonna say it right now
There isn't a group in the rap game today, that lyric for lyric
Can out-rap these next dudes. I know it for a mother-f*cking fact
I know it cause I'm from the west coast and I was there when Crooked I
First came on the scene, when Joell Ortiz first came on the scene
When Joe Budden first came on the scene, and one of the illest lyricist
In the game, when Royce Da 5'9 first came on the scene!
Welcome to: Our House, give it up for Slaughterhouse!

Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to you
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through you
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight to the radio
If you trying to be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei die
Tonight

Nigga, this that shooter music
I'm about that life so much I might go touch my rifles butt
And my dick just might go up
Nigga, that nostril on that rifle'll knock the snot right out you
Try me and I try out ya
The drum on the gun is Beta like Phi Alpha
But there ain't no frat niggas in the hood be calling me Tackleberry
And if he's iron, he will have him a easier time trying
To put on some pads and go in and try to tackle Barry
Then he go against this got damn G4 buying, Detroit lion
I'm about that life so much I might go golf
Trying to get me a hole-in-one to remind me of life when I go off
Homocidal thoughts, bodies outlined in chalk by the time it's dark
Dahmer signing his name on a dotted line with a bloody body part
I don't give a f*ck if they wilding, I got a clip full of f*cking Ray Allens
Selling that Sarah Palin, in broad day, a Letterman Fallon
When I shoot this iron, all you hear is hooping and hollin' like
(Bombs away) Bootsy Collins

Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to you
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through you
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight to the radio
If you trying to be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei die
Tonight

They shot my nigga three times, as his abdominal bled
They robbed him for phenomenal bread, that domino led
To other dominos fallin' in his clique, off with their heads, sick
Saw him in that hospital bed, leaned away from the doctor and said
They'll all be dead soon, and I'm talking before that nurse can change the IV
I'ma put em in the dirt, leave em leaking raspberry flavored ice tea
My G, kill him and take his ID
I'm a renegade like E-M-I-N-E-M and Ja-Y-Z
Bitch it's karate, it's Mr. Miyagi mixed with Issey Miyake
Smell that chopper kicking when it's lifting ya body
Quick as Bugattis, then I'm hitting the Omni
With a chicken licking my dick in the lobby; this New Edition, I'm Bobby
Fast laner
I'm speaking the truth, put 3 in the coupe
I'ma wet your head like a leak in the roof
Then I'm leaving the booth for gas chamber
My granny calling me a rap singer
But she don't know I use my strap finger

Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to you
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through you
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio

If you trying to be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei die
Tonight

Look, this a whole nother "Ether"
Hop out, black mask, low Caesar
Tell the goonies keep it low with the reefer
New bodies on old heaters
We ain't rapped too tight
Starving, they thought Jeffrey Dahmer had appetite
I'm detail, not derail
Don't lay your head if you shit by it
Got skeletons, but my shit private
I paved the way, y'all misguided
So try it, I'mma send a threat
Tie her up don't end her yet
Bullet go through your wife's eye now we know you ain't on the internet
In my head I see amateurs, can't retain a memory
All I'm left with is images
With that I'm putting emphasis
And in parentheses
Put he's hated by large percentages
And all my nemesis won't even let 'em on the premises
One shot, change him for life, he'll be belligerent
Even his text messages are gonna read like he's whispering
Bulletproofed the hoodie for Trayvon Martin
Then go to war with the cops, even they aren't pardoned

Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to you
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through you
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight to the radio
If you trying to be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei die
TonightMusic was my first love
And it will be my last.

I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knewIf I sent a rose to you
For every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white
For every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses

And if you took the petals
And you took them all apart
You'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you tore my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send some roses too
Well I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you

And if you took the petals
And you took them all apart
You'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you tore my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send some roses too
Well I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of youIt's happy hour again
I think I might be happy if I wasn't out with them
And they're happy it's a lovely place to be
Happy that the fire is real the barman is a she

Where the haircuts smile
And the meaning of style
Is a night out with the boss
Where you win or you lose
And its them who choose
And if you don't win then you've lost

What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never been happy for me (oh)

It's another night out with the boss
Following in footsteps overgrown with moss
And he tells me that women grow on trees
And if you catch them right they will land upon their knees

Where they open all their wallets
And they close all their minds
And they love to buy you all a drink
And then we ask all the questions
And you take all your clothes off
And go back to the kitchen sink

What a good place to be
Don't believe her
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me 
Don't believe her, oh no
'Cause it's never been happy for me

What a good place to be
Don't believe her
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me 
Don't believe her, oh no
'Cause it's never been happy for me (it's happy hour again)

Don't believe her, don't believe her (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe her(it's happy hour again)

And again, and again
It's happy hour again, and again, and again
It's happy hour again, and again, and again
It's happy hour againSeven days has gone so fast,
I really thought the pain would pass.
It's been nearly an hour,
Since I thought of you.

But your not answering the phone,
I'd settle for a busy tone,
At least that I'd know that you're okay.
A girl like you ain't meant to go away.
Oh

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame

I'm tired of this empty house,
I need a drink to get me out.
A couple more til I forget your name.

I saw a boy that looked like you,
I didn't know quite what to do,
It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.

Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame

If you see me coming
I look away, I look away
And if your mind is made up
I look away, I will look away

If your worry bound
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am
All this sorrow and this pain,
Is going to go away

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flameI had this thing to call my own
Just one slip and it was gone

A minor flaw and then it fell
I brought this house down on myself

I didn't know just what I'd done

I didn't know just what I'd done

I don't remember anymore what I used to be
Where is the quiet piece of home where I could breathe?

Just like a razor to my soul when I'm alone
Oh, I had this thing to call my own

I'm so confused, I cannot see
This wave of guilt is drowing me

It feels like blood is on my hands
I'd give it all for a second chance

I still don't know just what I've done
I still don't know just what I've done

I don't remember anymore what I used to be
There was a fire burning strong inside of me

Just like the soothing loving warmth of summer sun

Oh, I had this thing to call my own
I had this thing to call my own
I had this thing to call my own

I never meant to let you go
I never meant to let you go
I never meant to let you go
I never meant to let you go
To let you go, ohOh, this is the night, it's a beautiful night 
And we call it bella notte 
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes 
On this lovely bella notte

Side by side with your loved one 
You'll find enchantment here 
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near

For this is the night

On this lovely bella notteWithout you, without you
I always thought that everything was fine without you
Never knowing you'd be mine
Suddenly my world has changed
And I just wonder why
All it took was just one smile

[Chorus:]
Now with you, out of the blue
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd realize what love was
what love was, what love was

I need you, oh I need you
And everyday I love you more and more
Without you (dreams and tears)
I know what it's all for
Suddenly I see you there
And everything's ok
Don't know why I feel this way

[Chorus]

Here with you

We are together now
Never take my heart away
All the love I found
Is here to stay (Out of the blue)

It's like a dream come true
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
Out of the blue
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought
Here with you
Out of the, out of the, out of the clear blue
Oh, it's like a dream come true,
I never thought, I never thought
Out of the blue
Before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
Out of the, out of the, out of the, out of the clear blueEse hombre que tu tienes no estan en nada
que en vez de enamorarte te desgasta, no
tiene bueno modales, why no es atento contigo
ese hombre no se merece que le des tanto
cariÃ±o.

El duerme en la maÃ±ana why tu trabajas, why luego
por las noches se te escapa, te exige que tu le laves
que lo vistas why lo planches, why si a caso tu protestas
se indigna why quiere pegarte.


que le den candela, ay que le den castigo, que lo
metan en una holla why que se cocine en su vino
que le den candela, que le den castigo que lo borden
de una cometa why que luego corten el hilo

azucar, azucar

Ese hombre que tu tienes buena amiga, si yo fuera
tu le dejaria, las maletas en la puerta why una nota que dijera
apartir de este momento que te cocine tu abuela.

que le den candela, ay que le den castigo, que lo
metan en una holla why que se cocine en su vino
que le den candela, que le den castigo que lo borden
de una cometa why que luego corten el hilo.Blood is pumping, blood is pumping, blood is pumping
Blood is pumping, blood is pumping, blood is pumping
Blood is pumping, blood is pumping, blood is pumping

Finally kept my pride
And hailed a cab
 
Those cuttin' words you said
 
Were the last stab

There'll be no tears this time
They've all dried up

No more sweet poison
I already drank that cup
This tunnel's dark
But there's a little light glowing

Bright enough for me to run toward knowing
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
No pain this life will put me through
Will ever ever hurt like you


Don't need a miracle
A superhero
There's only one way up
When you're at zero
You took my innocence
But it was knowing
No I don't need you
And that made me a woman
I paid my dues
But that's a debt I'm done paying
I'm standing strong
But I'm still on my knees praying

Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
No pain this life will put me through
Will ever ever hurt like youIt came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deepWhy do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
(Fools fall in love)

Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
(Fools fall in love)

Love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see, for that fool is me
Tell me why, tell my why?

Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
(Fools fall in love)

Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
(Fools fall in love)

Why does my heart skip this crazy beat?
For I know, it will reach defeat
Tell me why, tell me why?
Why do fools fall in love?Ich schrieb einen Brief
Den ich nie schickte
Ich sagte adieu
Dem den ich liebte

Ich dachte so sei es besser
Um glücklich zu bleiben
Und so fand ich zu mir
Und so zu uns beiden

Und wenn die Winde drehn
Steigt unsere Chance
Es zu verstehn
Ich glaub daran

Dass alles einen Sinn macht
Irgendwann
Ich glaub daran
Dass alles einen Sinn macht
Irgendwann

Von hier bis dahin
Einen Fuss vor den andern
Bis da wo dann alles
Niemals mehr aufhört
Mit dir
Mit dir
Mit dir

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G. is on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin all alone

Just hit the eatside of the L.B.C.
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of skirts ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the 21 to Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said "let's do this"
I jumped out the ride, and said "what's up?"
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said "I'm stuck"

Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brothas and said "damn, what's next?"

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I besta pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said "ooh I like your size"
She said "my car's broke down and you seem real nice"
"Would you let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the east side motel

I'm tweaking
Onto a whole new level
G-Funk
Stept towards
I dare ya
Funk
On a whole new level
The rythmn is the base and the base is the treble
Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
Where rythmn is life
And life is rythmn
If you know like I know
You don't want to step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulateLord of all creation

The universe declares your majesty

Frank White jagt euch mit dem BMW, BMWI've thrown away my toys, even my drum and train.
I wanna make some noise with real live aeroplanes. 
Some day I'm going to fly, I'll be a pilot too. 
And when I do, how would you like to be my crew?

On The Good Ship Lollipop. 
It's a sweet trip to a candy shop 
Where bon-bons play 
On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.

Lemonade stands everywhere 
Crackerjack bands fill the air 
And there you are 
Happy landing on a chocolate bar.

See the sugar bowl do the tootsie roll 
With the big bad devil's food cake. 
If you eat too much ooh-ooh 
You'll awake with a tummy ache.

On The Good Ship Lollipop 
It's a night trip into bed you hop 
And dream away 
On The Good Ship Lollipop.Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
The sun will shine
In my back door some day

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living
Sometimes I feel like dying

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
Let the 2:19 train
Ease my trouble in mind

Trouble, oh trouble
Trouble's on your worried mind
When you see me laughing, baby
I'm laughing just to keep from crying

I'm going down to the river
I'm gonna take my old rocking chair
And if those blues overtake me
I'm gonna rock on away from there

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
My poor heart is beating slow
Never had no trouble
In my life before

Never had no trouble
In my life beforePicture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity.
Paint it with a skin of sky, brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me.

A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race.
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face.
But afraid, we may our home to waste.

There's a fear down here we can't forget hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around singing ashes to ashes all fall down.
Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime calls
And again the hunt begins and again the bloodwind calls

By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes.
It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Stalking turf, dividing up meat.

Nightmare spook, piece of heat, you and me, you and me.
Click, flashblade in ghetto night. Rudie's looking for a fight.
Rat cat alley roll them bones. Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politicians throwing stones

Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price.
Money green or proletarian gray, selling guns instead of food today.

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
While the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
Heartless powers try to tell us what to think

If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink.
History's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own.
If the game is lost then we're all the same

No one left to place or take the blame.
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or this shinning ball of blue we can call our home
So the kids they dance, they shake their bones

While the politicians are throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
Shipping powders back and forth
Singing "black goes south while white comes north"

And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing "I got mine and you got yours."
And the current fashions set the pace.
Lose your step, fall out of grace.

And the radical he rant and rage, Singing "someone got to turn the page"
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing "Just leave well enough alone"
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians are throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
'Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free

It's dizzying, the possibilities. Ashes, Ashes all fall down.I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because.. 

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because.. 

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back 
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because.. 

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time 

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love
I'm not in loveYou're doing everything your people said to
I'd hate to be the one to break it to you
It's only sad 'cause it's true
They misled you when they bred you
Somebody said some things they had no right to
Somehow they stuck, then you were known as someone who
Could simply not follow through if he had to
(But you have to, don't you?)

You don't have to be a genius, but it helps to (helps to)
Fools and charlatans, they may get wise
But only cream and bastards rise, and you can see it in their eyes

You followed good advice to the letter
You know your friend?
He's doing so much better than you are ever likely to do
He'll eclipse you and he will not miss you

You don't have to be a genius, but it helps to (helps to)
All the also-rans are real nice guys
But only cream and bastards rise:
People who can buy and sell you
Sharing a joke that they will never tell you
You think you're dialed in
Someone has to win, and you know what that means
It means someone's gotta lose
It's probably you

It's not a race, it's not a competition
And if it were you'd be in no position to
Get them to listen to you if you had to
Not even if your life depended on it

You don't have to be a genius, but it helps to (helps to)
Some are aliens, the rest are spies
But only cream and bastards rise, and you can see it in their eyesTu m'as promis

I don't blame you for sayin' no when you should have said yes
But darlin', darlin', darlin', look at me now I'm a mess

I'm a mess, I'm a wreck
I'm really on the deck
I'm a mess, look at how I'm living
Some of these days I'm gonna get back on my feet and quit this blue address
But darlin', darlin', darlin', in the meantime I'm a mess

The smart set, I used to run around with are invisible now
They all cut me loose when one said that what I've got might just rub of on
Them somehow
I'm a mess, for want of your caress
Darlin', darlin', darlin', look at me now I'm a messI'm thinking about you

I can't live without you

You're always on my mind

One time, to know how it feels.
That's all.

One call, your voice on the phone.
One place, a moment alone.
That's all.

What do you see?
What do you know?
One sign, what'll I do?
Just follow your lifeline through.

What if it hurts, what then?
What do we do, what do you say?
Don't throw your lifeline away

Don't throw your lifeline away

One time, just once in my life.
Yeah one time, to know it can't happen twice.
One shot on a clear blue sky.
One look, I see the reasons why you cared.

One chance to get back to the point where everything starts.
One chance to keep it together,
Things fall apart.

One sign to make us believe it's true.
What do you see, where do we go?
One sign, how do we grow?
By letting your lifeline show.

What if we do, what now?
What do you say, how do I know?
Don't let your lifeline go.

Don't let your lifeline go.Surfing on the bluest wave, I'm ready to go
Reaching for the shiny eye that swims below
Try to catch one, only the best one
I'm looking for the bluest wave

Try to catch one
Try to catch one, only the best one

Little tiny eyeballs see the places I've gone
They keep pictures of my old friends, they'll always live on
Every summer we come together
Looking for the bluest wave

Try to catch one
Try to catch one, only the best one
Try to catch one
Try to catch one, you're the best one

And it's coming down, raining like a pulse of light
And we're riding on the longest wave tonight
And if we ever get there, we'll all get laid tonight
Surfing on the bluest wave

Try to catch one, only the best one
Try to catch one, you're the best one
Try to catch one, only the best one
Try to catch one, you're the best one

But now I'm outside deciding. 
Older but wiser, 
This song's the decider. 
Is it the sound of a man wrestling with emotion, 
Or the sound of him losing 
And causing commotion? 
I'm nothing to my peers, 
But envy and hatred.

With a chart that she wants to show
The science of decisions

What are the subject values
How will the numbers go
She just did something funny
And my heart is beating so

I don't think that's fair

With procedures that she knows
She'll graph it with precision

So here I am in front of you
Not really knowing what to do
My heart is feeling something new
Nervously I turn away from you
I see the looks you're sending me
Is this the way it's meant to be?
It's something we should talk about
Just give me time to work it out

Something completely new to me
Now that I know you socially

This is the way it's meant to be
There's nothing left to talk about

It's a circus game with you and me.

But the tophat on my head is all you see.

And the wire seems to be the only place for me
A comedy of errors and I'm falling
Like a rubber neck giraffe, you look into my past
Well, baby you're just too blind to see.

I'm up in the spotlight, oh does it feel right
The altitude seems to really get to me.

Courage to change the things I can 
And the wisdom to know the difference 

I am not like I was before 
I thought that nothing would change me 
I was not listening anymore 
Still you continued to affect me 

I was not thinking anymore 
Although I said I still was 
I'd said "I don't want anymore" 
Because of bad experience

It's your Irish heart I'm after
Peg o'my heart
Your glances make my heart say "How's chances?"
Come, be my own, come make your home in my heart
I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "this is absurd"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "long live the look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be rememberedHey there Mr. Leaf Blower Man 
Keep it down for goodness sake 
It's way too early in the morning 
Can't you please use your wooden rake 
You choose to ignore I 
Even though me hungover 
That's not being nice 
So tonight, your head will be covered in lice 

Voodoo spell on you 
Voodoo Voodoo 
You shouldn't have given that dirty stare 
Voodoo Voodoo 
Too late for sorry, go cut off your hair 

Hey there old, old woman 
Shopping for food at the store 
Why'd you run your cart into I 
And knock me eggs on the floor 
Then took the last unbruised cantelope 
And laughed so loud with glee 
But you won't be laughing 
'Cause from now on it'll burn when you pee 

Voodoo spell on you 
Voodoo Voodoo 
You couldn't have made I any madder 
Voodoo Voodoo 
That's why I put a curse on your bladder 

Boodaloo Boodalay 
Boodalee Boodalie 
Are the words that he say 
When you f*ck with I 
Voodoo 

Hey there Mr. State Trooper 
Me was only going 58 
Please don't you write up that ticket 
It'll ruin me insurance rate 
You say you have a quota to meet 
So straight to hell with I 
Me have only one response 
Boodalee Boodalie 

Voodoo spell on you 
Voodoo Voodoo 
You cost I eighty dollars cash 
Voodoo Voodoo 
Me hope you like your new skin rashSONO UMANE SITUAZIONI QUEI MOMENTI FRA DI NOI

There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you (how those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung 'round her by the score
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)

She was tops in all they said
It never once went to her head
She had everything it seems
Not a care, this teenage queen (not a care, this teenage queen)
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen you should be a movie queen)

He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out (came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town (but she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train (left it all and caught a train)
Do I have to tell you more
She came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store

(Now this story has some more, you'll hear it all at the candy store)Wir hatten Sonne und Sterne
Und die Dünen nur und das weite Meer
Und mir war als ob die Zeit

Es gab nur uns beide für mich 
Ich wusste, ich hatte dich
Wie einfach und klar doch alles war

Deine Spuren im Sand (deine Spuren im Sand)

Was gehört nun noch mir?
Deine Liebe sie schwand (deine Liebe sie schwand)
Wie die Spuren im Sand
Was ist mir nur geblieben?
Nur die Sehnsucht nach dir

Ich weiß nicht, wann du anfingst
Ohne mich den Strand entlang zu gehen
Und wenn ich dich danach fragte
Stumm an mir vorbeizusehen
Bis man die ganze Wahrheit versteht
Ist es nicht selten zu spät
Da bin ich nun, was kann ich tun?

Deine Spuren im Sand (deine Spuren im Sand)

[Chorus:]
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice
Everybody spread the word
We're gonna have a celebration
All across the world
In every nation
It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together
To release the pressure
We need a holiday
(chorus)
You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Put your troubles down
It's time to celebrate
Let love shine
And we will find
A way to come together
And make things better
We need a holiday

Holiday, Celebration
Come together in every nation
(Thanks to Leyla for these lyrics)Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, you believed in me
I believed in you

Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dream to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive, 
As we used to do?

Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say

Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away

You must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say

Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away

You must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

You must love meSomewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?I, I always thought that I knew,
I'd always have the right to,
Be living in the kingdom of the good and true.

And so on,
But now I think I was wrong.
And you were laughing along
And now I look a fool for thinking you were on
My side.

Is it any wonder that I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

Sometimes,
It's hard to know where I stand.
It's hard to know where I am.
Well maybe it's a puzzle I don't understand.

Sometimes,
I get the feeling that I'm
Stranded in the wrong time.
Where love is just a lyric in a children's rhyme,
A sound-bite.

Is it any wonder that I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

Oh these days,
After all the misery you made.
Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?

Nothing left inside this old cathedral,
Just the sad lonely spires.
How do you make it right?

Oh but you try.

Is it any wonder that I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

Oh these days.
After all the misery you made,
Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells

Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells

Give us this day all that you showed me,
The power and the glory 'til thy kingdom come
Give me all the story book told me,
The faith and the glory 'til thy kingdom comes

And they said that in our time,
All that's good will fall from grace
Even saints would turn their face,
In our time

And they told us that in our days,
Different words said in different ways,
Have other meaning from he who says,
In our time.

Give us this day all that you showed me,
The power and the glory 'til thy kingdom come
Give me all the story book told me,
The faith and the glory 'til thy kingdom comes

And they said that in our time,
We would reap from their legacy,
We would learn from what they had seen,
In our time.

And they told us that in our days,
We would know what was high on high,
We would follow and not defy,
In our time.

Give us this day all that you showed me,
The power and the glory 'til thy kingdom come
Give me all the story book told me,
The faith and the glory 'til thy kingdom comes

Faithless in faith
We must behold the things we see

You got to sing sometimes like you don't need the money
Love sometimes like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance, dance, dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart if you want it to work
RÊVE DE TI-CUL
(Alexandre Poulin / Alexandre Poulin)


J’avais sept ans quand j’ai trouvé
Un vieux hockey de gardien de but
Caché dans’ cave, derrière
Une grosse pile de revues

Mon père m’a souri étrangement
Quand il l’a aperçu
Y’a dit : « Habille-toé, mon grand
On s’en va jouer dans’ rue »

Ce soir-là, j’ai compté
Mon premier tour du chapeau
Contre mon père rouillé
Qui se prenait pour Casso

Moi, je maniais
La rondelle comme par magie
J’étais pus un p’tit gars
J’étais Wayne Gretzky

C’est cette nuit-là qu’j’ai vraiment compris
C’que j’allais faire plus tard
Vêtu de bleu, blanc, rouge, j’allais briller
Sur toutes les patinoires

Trois semaines plus tard, j’gagnais ma première coupe Stanley
Faite en papier d’aluminium
En la tenant au-dessus d’moé, j’ai su
C’que c’était que d’être un homme

Pendant des années, j’vous jure
J’ai tout fait pour être repêché
Jusqu’à c’qu’on me dise
Que c’tait pas assez

J’me s’rai tout de même rendu
Jusqu’au junior majeur
Où on m’a dit : « T’as pas les mains
Mais crisse que t’as du cœur »

Chu tombé de mon nuage
J’ai caché mon hockey pis accroché mes patins
En pensant à mon père, qu’y’avait un jour
Lui aussi caché le sien

J’ai pas trouvé les mots pour vous dire
À quel point ça m’a détruit
Aujourd’hui, quand j’y repense, en quelque part
J’m’en suis toujours pas remis

J’ai tout tenté
Pour compenser l’ivresse de jouer
En manquant pas une game
À’ TV

Pis j’ai compris que pour
Retoucher mon nuage
J’pouvais juste être la star
D’une ligue de garage

Fa’ que le mercredi soir
Quand je saute sur la glace qui reluit
Chu un p’tit gars
Chu Wayne Gretzky

On n’oublie jamais
Ses rêves de ti-cul
Dès qu’mon gars est assez vieux
J’l’emmène jouer au hockey dans’ rueThe weather is frightening.
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day. 
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.Well we're, 
I said we're traveling at a speed of a reborn man
We got a lot of love to give
You better come on if you can
So I talk about love
They try to run away
Check yourself out baby
And then come with me today
Mmm mmm good lover
Over here
Hey
Dooooo yeah!
Dooooo yeah!

Mmm so good
Yeah, oh so tasty
Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chain
You're foolin' with that fool baby
You put your life in pain
If you want to be free
Come on along with me
And leave the hard headed man
He'll never understand
I said a find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
For it could come alive 
Then prove to the man
That understands
The eyes are god

Whoo
Come one baby

Doodoo doodoo...

Everybody memorize
Everybody love a lot
Everybody here today

Hey
Yeah, yeah
Hey
Come on baby
Come on
Come on
Fly with me babyLadies and gentlemen let's have a fine hand for The Byrds

Catfish pie in a gris-gris bag
I'm the lover of the bayou
Mark your doorstep with a half-wet rag
I'm the lover of the bayou

Raised and swam with the crocodile
Snacked-eye taught me the moyo style
Sucked and weaned on chicken bile
I'm the lover of the bayou, yeah

Well, I learned the key to the master lock
I learned to float in the water clock
I learned to capture the lightnin' shock
I'm the lover of the bayou

And I've got cats and teeth and hair for sale
I'm the lover of the bayou
Baron Samedi is on your tail
I'm the lover of the bayou

I cooked the bat in the gumbo pan
Drank the blood from a rusty can
Turned me into the hunger man
I'm the lover of the bayou, yeahOn the blue side of the evenin'
When the darkness takes control
You start lookin' for a reason
To take your lonesome on down the road

'Cause the night is filled with strangers
All you need is one you know
If she ain't the one you're after
Keep on lookin' on down the road

Though the miles lay long behind you
You have still got miles to go
How's love ever gonna find you
If it ain't here it's down the road

Though the miles lay long behind you
You have still got miles to go

On the blue side of the evenin'
When the darkness takes controlNada me importa cuando me besas
De todo me olvido cuando no miro 
Tus lindos ojos es un martirio

Si tu supieras cuando te tengo
Entre mis brazos mucho disfruto 
De tus caricias y tus encantos
 
Nada me importa lo que me digan

And them crying

We heard the voices crying out
In the valley asking for help
And we're their only hope
So we're here sending a message

We heard the voices crying out
In the valley asking for help
And we're their only hope
So we're here sending a message

How many times do we have to see
Our brothers die in street?
From a bullet by another brother
Trying to find food to eat

Just to survive we've gotta be enemies
That is how we get defeat
So that's why we're delivering this message
To every leader in the world

We heard the voices crying out
In the valley asking for help
And we're their only hope
So we're here sending a message

We heard the voices crying out
In the valley asking for help
And we're their only hope
So we're here sending a message

How many times should we hear the voice
Of mothers cry and weep
Because they can't assist
The needs of their own youths in the community

Our people cry and ask for help
Still you don't care about their needs
I hope to see a change some day
This is to every leader in the world

We heard the voices crying out
In the valley asking for help
And we're their only hope
So we're here sending a message

Their wailing, their wailing
The people are wailing

How many times do we have to see
Our brothers die in street?
From a bullet by another brother
Trying to find food to eat

Just to survive we've gotta be enemies
That is how we get defeat
So that's why we're delivering this message
To every leader in the world

We heard the voices crying out

(David Lee Murphy)

She sat on the front porch and pulled on her boots
In her favorite old faded blue jeans
And one tail waggin' puppy climbed up into her arms
And I could tell he felt just like me
No matter where she goes he's never too far behind
When she steps out into that morning light

She really something to see
My dream comes alive
When I open my eyes
And I still go weak in the knees
She's too good to believe
And I can tell you that she's
Really something to see

I've seen her in moonlight on soft summer nights
With ten thousand stars in the sky
And in a room full of candles like an angel in white
While the heavens rumbled outside
No matter where she goes I'm never too far behind
When she steps out into that morning light

She really something to see
My dream comes alive
When I open my eyes
And I still go weak in the knees
She's too good to believe
And I can tell you that she's
Really something to see


It's like that movie you've seen time after time
Where you always find something you've missed
Well I could sit here right now and just watch her for hours
'Cause I know my world has been blessed

She really something to see
My dream comes alive
When I open my eyes
And I still go weak in the knees
She's too good to believe
And I can tell you that she's
Really something to see
I'm a shot in the dark
Try to aim for my heart
But you'll miss

You knew from the start
I ain't no walk in the park
Yes you did

You can call in the guards
Tell 'em to aim for my heart
But they'll miss

You say you go hard, huh
Well I ain't feelin it

I'm wanted dead or alive
'Cuz there's a price tag on my life
No one's gonna take my heart from me
No one's gonna take my heart from me
Looks like I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm wanted D.O.A.

The X marks the spot
And the target's my heart
Try to hit

You reshuffle the cards
But I still come out on top
This is it

An undercover cop
But you revealed who you are
Yes you did, oh

You say you go hard, huh
But I'm not feelin it, ohFor your love
For your love
I'd give you everything and more and that's for sure
(For your love)
I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
(For your love)
To thrill you with delight,
I'd give you diamonds bright
Double takes I will excite,
Make you dream of me at night
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love,
For your love
I would give the stars above
For your love,
For your love
I would give you all I could

I'd give the moon if it were mine to give
(For your love)
I'd give the stars and the sun for I live

Jan Wayne is back again...
Looking from the window above, it's like a story of love, can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday, we're moving farther away, want you near me

[Chorus:]
All I needed was the love you gave, all I needed for another day
And all I ever knew - only you
Badadadam, badadadam, badadadam, badadam
Badadadam, badadadam, badadadam
This is how we do it!
Badadadam, badadadam, badadadam, badadam
Badadadam, badadadam, badadadam, badadam

Sometimes when I think of your name, and it's only a game, that I need you,
Listening to the words that you say, it's getting harder to stay, when I see you

[Chorus:]

All I needed was the love you gave, all I needed for another day
And all I ever knew - only you
Can you hear me?

Bada, bada, badadadam, badadadam, badadadam

Badadadam, badadadam, badadadam, badadam
Badadadam, badadadam, badadadamTell her try your best just to make it quick
Whom attend to the sick
'Cause there must be something she can do
This heart is broken in two
Tell her it's a case of emergency
There's a patient by the name of Gregory

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this jah thirst
My night nurse, oh gosh
Oh the pain it's getting worse
I don't wanna see no doc
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock

'Cause there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy
Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this jah thirst

My night nurse
Oh the pain it's getting worse
I hurt my love
I don't wanna see no doc

I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
'Cause there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this jah thirst
My night nurse
Oh the pain it's getting worse

I hurt my love
And I'm sure no doctor can cure
Night nurse, night nurseI know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up 
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Gotta astrung when I heard when 
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
It was empires in Africa called Kush 
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 
Gold was converted to money it all changed 
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded 
They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
Still goes on today, you see? 
If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
They learn to survive until they gain control 
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Prince that's when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying "She's my queen"

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the musicYou want to get close to me
The feeling so clear
But I need some time to see
Vision through my tear
You want to get next to me
I need your intrusion
I don't need to be
Blinded by confusion

Here is my heart
Waiting for you
Here is my soul

So you want to get over me
And that's how you feel
Everything you want to be
Seems so unreal
I want to be all of you
And that's the confusion
It's so hard for me
To draw a conclusion
 
Here is my heart
Waiting for you
Here is my soul
I eat at chez nous
 
Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way

I believe that there's a way
If you want it to
Will love find a way

Love will find a wayA prima donna, slipped into her leather 
But she was restless 
She knew it in her heart of hearts 
She said "Tonight you'd better pull yourself together, 
Because tonight I'm gonna pull myself apart!" 
Out on the streets 
Everyone is searchin' for a thrill 
But she's the only one that's out there 
really dressed to kill 
And she said "Listen to me, it's not a tragedy, 
This time I'm gettin' thorough and now there's 
something you can do for me! 

And oh, oh, take me to the Wild Places 
And let me show you what the night is for 
Cos I don't wanna dream 
I wanna set the wheels in motion 
I don't wanna see your eyes across a dancin' floor" 

TV angel with her eyes full of smoke 
Gazin' at the hero, he's so mucho macho 
He shrugs, he says "This must be some kind on joke." 
As she pulls on his cigarette and loves him to distraction. 
But she cries, "I don't wanna feel like a machine 
I'm not the only one who wants to feel the in-between 
That's why I'm deep into this state of fascination 
That's why I've lost the art of conversation. 

And oh, oh, take me to the Wild Places 
If you wanna see what's really in my soul 
But you'd better keep your eye on where my pretty face is 
Cos in the heat of the moment I just lose control 
In the heat of the moment, I just lose control!" 

Eyes out of focus, the sharpening of blades 
The sad tension, reek of patchouli 
Even the jokers are dealin' in spades 
It's one dimension, it's all so passé' 
Just then a voice said, 
"Honey, it's too late to change your mind" 
Her face tightened 
I could see she'd found a new design 
and she said, "Listen to me, it's just a fantasy 
This time I'm comin through 
and now there's something you can do for me... 
There's something you can do for me! 

And oh, oh, take me to the Wild Places 
And let me show you what the night is for 
I don't wanna dream, I wanna set the wheels in motion 
Cos' in the heat of the moment I just lose control 
In the heat of the moment I just lose control."
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am.

In the days between the hours
Ivory towers, bloody flowers
Push their heads in to the air
I don't care if I ever know
There I go

Don't push your love too far
Your wounds won't leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
Did someone bow their head ?
Did someone break the bread ?
Good people are in bed
Before nine o'clock.

On the pad before my eyes
Paper cries, tellin' lies
The promises you gave
From the grave of a broken heart
Hmm

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am. Oh.

I sit here in my lonely room

Don't push your love too far
You know your wounds won't even leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
And don't you forget what I say

Hoo, hooI want to say I fear the wind
You saw hope
The feeling's real
The feeling's old

Past your skin
Burnt out
Wasted
On your way

Sinking
Slowly
Call my name

Though I knew you were to fall
Take this will I see you burning bright
'Cause you and me
We were able to

Able to laugh
Spring came
Grew wings again and left no hope

I won't be alone
You won't be alone
I will share your wishes and voice
With other able hands

Fallen frames
Your face is gone
I stay in
Stifled home

It's been erased
This your load
Forced out
Empty

'Cause to run
Sinking
Only float for fun
And though I knew you'd fight them all

Take this will I see you burning bright
'Cause you and me

We were able to
Able to laugh
Spring came
Grew wings again and left no hope

I won't be the same
I won't be the same
I will share your laughter and your joy
With other able handsCan I run, run, run from a jester with a gun
Jokes are stupid in the light of never knowing where to run
Heavy Scenes Yeah
When I try to smile instead I get bullets in my head
Drop the bottle , close your eyes and hit the throttle, vocalize
This heavy scene yeah,
Every night I close my eyes trying not to dramatize,
But I'm nervous in my head 'cause I don't want to end up dead
Heavy scenes
Yeah there's beauty in the deep, still my life is incomplete,
Don't want to be no piece of meat 'cause I don't look good in concrete,
Heavy scenes yeah
And I say "Oh no what you doing?"
Try to run from a bully with a gun well it ain't no fun
When your time has overrun with heavy scenes
Oh no what you saying? Egomaniac you're crawling on my back,
Need a new plan of attack to escape this cul de sac
I can only watch, I cannot play,
I can' hardly talk 'cause there's nothing to say, so I 'll run
Heavy scenes yeah, Oh no, heavy scenes yeah, oh no
Tattooed Princes make a fistful of fun like latex love birdies a cookin in the sun
And the half baked mommies with their babies on the beat
Turn ice cube cool when the candy hits the street
Mirror-eyed shades stalk the planet whisper riddles
Jealous one eyed lovers like to fidget while you fiddle,
Then a wall of crumpled nothing tumbles down till you surrender
To the cost of making lovers out of princes and pretenders
Man made machinery evolves and takes the stage
From a cast of bittered thousands gilded, rusted golden cage,
Silver spoonz that lick their bottomz open up the bird's eye view
To those short weekend encounters with your paperback guru
Oh no what you doing?
Try to run from a bully with a gun well it ain't no fun
When your time has overrun with heavy scenes
Oh no what you saying? Egomaniac you're crawling on my back,
Need a new plan of attack to escape this cul de sac of heavy scenes,heavy scenes
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, yeah
Heavy, heavy scene yeah , Back in black egomainiac,
Heavy, heavy scene yeah
Heavy, heavy scene yeah
Heavy, heavy scene yeah
Egomaniac you're crawling on my back, need a new plan of attackI called the doctor 
In the morning 
I had a fever 
It was a warning 
She said "There's nothing I can prescribe 
To keep your raunchy bag of bones alive" 
I got some money left for one more shot 
She said "God bless you" I said "Thanks a lot" 

It's a slow, slow death 

I called the preacher 
Holy, holy 
I begged forgiveness 
That's when he told me 
He said "There's nothing I can prescribe 
To keep your raunchy bag of bones alive" 
I got some money left for one more shot 
He said "God bless you" I said "Thanks a lot" 

Slow Death 

I'm set to mainline 
A hit of morphine 
It's set to mainline 
It's like a bad dream 
Slow death--eat my mind away 
Slow death--turn my guts to clay 
It's a slow, slow, slow deathTell me tell me is life just a playground
Think you're the real deal honey
And someone'll always look after you

Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two. 

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid, 
Where would I be without you, 
Give us a wink and make me think of youEast of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune

Take me up your stairs and through the door

I'm looking for you 
Drifting on a memory 
Ain't no place I'd rather be 
Than with you, loving you 
Day will make a way for night 
All we'll need is candlelight 
And a song soft and long, well 
Glad to be here alone 
With a lover unlike no other 
Safe to see a new horizon 
Slowly coming into view 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Lovely as a ray of sun 
That touches me when the morning comes 
Feels good to me, my love and me 
Smoother than a gentle breeze 
Flowing through my mind with ease 
Soft as can be well when you're loving me 
Love to be Riding the waves of your love 
Enchanted with your touch It seems to me 
We can sail together in and out of mystery 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Paradise I have within 
Can't feel insecure again 
You're the key and this I see 
Now and then I lose my way 
Using words to try and say 
What I feel yeah love is real 
Ooh I might as well 
Sign my name on a card 
Which could say it better 
Time will tell 
'Cause it seems that I've done 
Just about all that I can do do do 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of youEnamorados como dos locos que se han encontrado
Como si siempre yo te hubiera buscado y esperado
En mis brazos te atrapo y te amarro estamos enamorados
Y aunque la gente no lo entienda es en vano
Porque no hay nada que pudiera dejarnos
Nos amamos porque somos dos almas gemelas
Que se han encontrado, enamorados

No es necesario que me digas ni una sola palabra mas
Desde el primer momento en que te vi
Sabia que algo había cambiado en el cielo, en el alma
El regalo que me haría feliz
Y lloraste una rosa al cielo
Y los ángeles gritaron te quiero
Y nos amamos contra todos los vientos
Y lloramos enamorados, enamorados, enamorados
Enamorados, enamorados, enamorados

Enamorados como dos tontos que se han encontrado
Como si siempre te hubiera buscado y esperado
En mis brazos te atrapo y te amarro estamos enamorados
Aunque la gente no lo entiende es en vano
Porque no hay nada que pudiera dejarnos
Nos amamos porque somos dos almas gemelas
Que se han encontrado, enamorados
Enamorados, enamorados, enamoradosShe just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, yhe world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything
What's a little bit of hunger?
I could go a little while longer, she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh, oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are (no better you than the you that you are)
No better life than the life we're living (no better life than the life we're living)
No better time for your shine, you're a star (no better time for your shine, you're a star)
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautifulThe night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heartWenn die Großstadt schweigt
beginnt's.
Wenn der Tag schweigt
beginnt's.
Dann steht neben mir

Diesen traum von dir

Heute tut es mir so leid
denn der Weg zu dir ist weit.
Meine Eifersucht

Oh

Meine melodie von dir

Was mag jetzt gescheh'nnn da in der ferne.
Was geschieht

Und da steht ein Bild vor mir.
Das ist noch ein Bild von dir.

Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.Torch girl of the marshes
Her kiss is a whip of the moon
Dawn's damsels are dancing
To the hum of her sunny young tune

Gems hemmed in the heart's head
The shield of the rivers is hers
She one told me to think white
And the night disappeared like a bird

Hold the glove of gold behind you
Love the love of Truth.



For the love of a woman a man unlocks his heart
And reveals all the secrets it holds
And the love of a woman will find his better part
When he gives her the key to his soul


He will listen to her dreams
He will ask her what she needs
He will help her build the life she wants to live
He will hold her when she cries
With a love that never dies
All these things he will give
For the love of a woman

For the love of a woman a man will sacrifice
While he waits for a moment of grace
With the love of a woman a man will pay the price
For the trust that he sees in her face
He will open any door
Leave the life he knew before
To convince her that he's all she'll ever need
And when he's afraid to start
He will step into the dark
'Cause he knows she'll give his eyes the power to see
With the love of a woman

And her promises to help her dreams come true
No there's nothing in this world that he won't do

Though he's not a work of art
He will try with all his heart
To become the man she knows that he can be
With the love of a woman
The love of a woman
He will give his life
For the love of a womanI kissed the kids at noon
Then stumbled out the room
I caught a cab, ran up a tab
On 7th and Flower

Best recital, I had to run
Missed my son's graduation
Punched the Nickle's boy
For taking his seat
He gets all that anger from me

Still things could be much worse
Natural disasters on the evening news
Still things could be much worse
We still got our health
My paycheck in the mail

I promised to my wife and children
I'd never touch another drink
As long as I live but even then
It sounds so soothing
This will blow over in time
This will all blow over in time

I'm just an honest man
Provide for me and mine
I give a check to tax deductible
Charity organizations

Two weeks paid vacation
Won't heal the damage done
I need another one

Still things could be much worse
Natural disasters on the evening news
Still things could be much worse
We still got our health
My paycheck in the mail

I promised to my wife and children
I'd never touch another drink
As long as I live but even then
It sounds so soothing to mix a gin
And sink into oblivion

I promised to my wife and children
That accident left everyone a little shook up
But at the meetings I felt so empty
This will blow over in time
This will all blow over in time

Mm la da da da da ah da da da da ah oh
Ah la da da da la da da da da ah la da da da oohYou ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, "Go 'long blues".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, "Go 'long blues".A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an "Oh, beg your pardon"
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said "May I have the next one?"
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words "Ever after"
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dreamLust he follows virtue close
Through the steaming woodlands
His darkened blood through bulging veins
Through the steaming woodlands
Aah, aah
Virtue knows he follows softly
Through the steaming woodlands
Travel light the deathly shudder
Down the leafy pathway
Aah, ah, aah, ah
La-la-la-la-la-la
The dim light she comes peering through the forest pines
And she knows by the sound of the baying, by the baying of the hounds
Diana Diana kick your feet up
Lust bears his teeth and whines
For he's picked up the scent of virtue
And he knows the panic signs

Lust cries running with his eyes the white-clad figure fleeting
Mud burns his eyes but desire burns his mind
Fear in her eyes as the forest grins through the steaming woodlands
Lust now his destroyed with enmity disarmed

Diana, Diana, Diana, Diana
Diana, Diana, Diana, Diana
Diana, Diana, Diana, Diana
Diana, Diana, Diana, Diana

The dim light she comes peering through the forest pines
And she knows by the sound of the baying, by the baying of the hounds

For a special purpose
You know?
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart

With a great big hug 
And a kiss from me to you
Won't you say you love me too?You went uptown riding in your limousine
In your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand
And the spoon up your nose
And when you wake up in the morning
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me

Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You know what everything's about
You and to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night

They were all impressed with your Halston dress
And the people you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
Kept 'em so entertained
But now you just can't remember
All the things you said
And you're not sure you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show

Yes, yes, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You hand to the last word, last night
You're so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night

Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
So much fun to be around
You had to have a white hot spotlight

A lot of trouble with a brown eyed handsome man

Well a beautiful a daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her, "Darlin' go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man"

Well the Milo de Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To win a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Well-a two, three the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stands
A-rounding third he was a-heading for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game it was a brown eyed handsome manPast lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around

Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming

All my past lives they got nothing on me
Golden eagle you're the one and only flying high
Through the cities in the sky

I'll take you way back, countless centuries
Don't you remember that you were meant to be
My Queen of Hearts, meant to be my love

Through all of my lives
I'd never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned

So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Swear to the moon, the stars, the sons and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water

(Hey)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long

Passing seasons, empty bottles of wine
My ancient kingdom came crashing down without you
Baby child, I'm lost without your love

Diamond sparrow, my moonlit majesty
You know I need you, come flying back to me

Through all of my lives
I'd never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned

So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Respect to the moon, the stars, their sons and their daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water

(Hey)

I'll be around from now on
Your latest love can never last, and when it's past
I'll be around when she's gone

Goodbye again, and if you find a love like mine
Just now and then, drop me a line to say you're feeling fine

And when things go wrong, perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So I'll be around when she's gone

Just now and then, drop me a line to say you're feeling fine

And when things go wrong, perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So I'll be around when she's goneAs a means of release
Pick up my little pieces of heaven
'Tis a social disease when I cry
As you head for the door
I want it all, you can take it all leave it

With the light coming in
My desire to give in runs away with me
If I'm not good enough and my love is too much
Then forget it
Now I am strong carry me home
You can take it or leave it

God help me but forgive my true intention
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run
All this time still falling out of love

As we cut to the thrust
This could well be the year of decision
Do you know what I mean
Like a song spinning round in my head?
Now I am strong carry me home
You can take it or leave it

God help me but forgive my true intention
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run
All this time still falling out of love

I want it all, give me it all
I want it all, give me it all

God help me but forgive my true intention
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run
God help me but forgive my true intention
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run
All this time still falling out of love
All this time still falling out of loveI'm staying out for the summer
Playing games in the rain
The hills and the fortune
Got me fooled again

You see I work in a factory (I need the money)
I don't want to be late (Though I hate this place)
I got my debts to pay for (Free me from this race)
They're going to have to wait

If I ever see you again
I will tell you why (Tell you why)
I was low and insecure
I didn't want to make you cry

Well my good's turned bad
And it's just my luck that
You're not on my side
So what happens now? Where did you go?
With these feelings I hide?

Staying out for the summer!

I've had enough lining
Pockets I've never met
They've got me working all hours
I ain't gained nothing yet

If I ever see you again
I will tell you why (Tell you why)
I was low and insecure (If I ever see you cry)

Won't be the same again

I'm staying out for the summer

About nothing and everything all at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or am I just stoned

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining cause it's bringing her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
A ya-ya-ya

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or am I just stoned?She wanna be a bad girl,

De tu cuerpo lo más, lo más bello
Que hay en ti

One step behind don't make you what you're worth
Blue collar pride, breathing that salty earth
Pay every price, can't keep that dollar bill
It ain't much desire when you're done, lost your will

Hey, hey Joe...Lolita nie en bloc elle navigue au loin
Sous les cils à cent lieues de se douter que
Les silences et la jalousie la guettent
Elle oublie la liste et l'allonge
Encore elle veut s'isoler
Et alors elle s'absorbe dans la contemplation
De ses pieds

Un ange passe
Un ange passe

Et puis son doigt décrit dans l'air
Des étoiles ou bien des éclairs
Elle ignore si superbement
Les sentiments les aléas de l'amour
Elle s'avance vers la fenêtre
Abandonnée lascive et elle
Couvre le ciel de mille signes étranges et inconnus de tous

Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her the nature of my flight

As we taxi toward the runway
With the smog and haze reminding me
Of how I feel

Just a country boy who's learning
That the pitfalls of the city are extremely real

All the nightlife and the parties
Temptation and deceit
The order of the day

We'll it's a bloody Mary morning
And I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in L.A.

Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her the nature of my flight

Now our golden jet is airborne
And flight #50 cuts a path across the morning sky

And a voice comes through the speaker
Reassuring us flight #50 is the way to fly

And a hostess takes our order
Coffee, tea, or something stronger to start off the day

It's a bloody Mary morning
And I'm leaving baby somewhere in L.A.

Forgetting her the nature of my flightEight miles high and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own

Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town known for its sound
In places small faces unbound

Round the squares huddled in storms
Some laughing some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes and black limousines
Some living some standing aloneOld man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kissEverything she loved has left her 
In one way or another 
So blindly, she calls out 
In the middle of this sleepless night 
Those scars that dig so deep 
This piece of mind that's just not right 
She looks up to the sky 
She calls out, and she says 

My life is falling down like rain 
And I'll be the one to drown 
My whole world is nothing but pain 
And I'll be the one to drown 

Her eyes as blue as the life she leads 
Never thinking what she could have been 
Why me, she calls out 
In the middle of this heartless night 
How could the one she loves most 
Give her the pain she feels inside 
She looks up to the sky 
She calls out, and she says 

Let your rain fall down on meWish I was down on some blue bayou
With a bamboo cane stuck in the sand
But the road I'm on, don't seem to go there
So I just dream, keep on being the way I am 

Wish I enjoyed what makes my living
Did what I do with a willin' hand
Some would run, ah, but that ain't like me
So I just dream and keep on bein' the way I am

The way I am, don't fit my shackles

Tu olvidando tu miedo, yo mis desvelos

Gaviota herida, también tu cada noche
Miras el cielo, donde tus alas
Tan libres como nubes, siempre se abrieron
Yo sé que una mañana, vendra la vida
A llamar a tu puerta no la despidas
Gaviota herida, que yo también de nuevo
Vuelvo a la vida

Extenderé mis brazos, sobre las olas
Y llenaré mis ojos, de tu alegria
Y dejaré una pena, oculta entre las rocas
Para seguir tu rumbo, al nacer el dia
Gaviota mia, gaviota mia
Y olvidaremos juntas, nuestras heridas

Gaviota herida, reflejo de una tierra
Que se levanta, estando viva
Tu corazón de pueblo, por qué no canta
Despierta la esperanza, que esta dormida

Y llama en mi ventana
Amiga mia, gaviota herida
Que yo también contigo
Vuelvo a la vida

Extenderé mis brazos, sobre las olas
Y llenaré mis ojos, y dejaré una pena
Oculta entre las rocas, para seguir tu rumbo
Al nacer el dia, gaviota mia, gaviota mia
Y olvidaremos juntas, nuestras heridasIt's not right, but it's now or never
And if I wait, could I ever forgive myself?
On a night when the moon glows yellow in the riptide
With the light from the TV's buzzing in the house

'Cause I'm gonna cut it where I can
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you

To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81, oh-oh, oh-oh

Dressed in white with my car keys hidden in the kitchen
I could sleep wherever I lay my head
And the sight of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
Let me know that I shouldn't give up just yet

'Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you

We found ourselves in bed, when I woke up, he was gone

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81

Looking out at the ice-cold water all around me
I can't feel any traces of that other place
In the dark, when the wind comes racing off the river
There's a car all black with diplomatic platesYou know we got it sewn for now 
Cause I throws it down 
Plus I'm frozen down with a golden sound 
Where that lye at? 
I blow blunt backwards nigga try that 
Dat expose these high acts 
To my rap when my gat blow I's more than just about rap 
Strong hold a Giant and his fam 
I doubt that gonna make cats flip with or without rap 
But still makin' hits nigga where your mouth at? 
How's that? 
Bounce the track with a rap I doubt you pack 
I'm straight up motherf*ck yo cats is out the back

Blessed to make to the loot investin' my troops 
And holdin' my rests known for chest in arrest

The next stop is the money train 
See me in the Range then you know that the money came 

Want to be blown retarded I got a jones for dollars 
And if you know what I know you'll say "those niggas hit the hardest" 
Roll with known robbers but still burn scholar 
With PhDs my degrees is 360 
Merked off in the zero that follows the fifty 
I believe I can fly even higher than these trees get me 
I brought the desert E's with me 
With more clips than a bag of roaches 
I'm mad explosive 
Keep watchin' y'all fowl like judges in boxin' 
Out fox'em you better hold your head it's not an option 
Exel on the spot 
You're shell shocked 
I show niggas first it was catch and kiss 
Now nigga catch a dick 
Like 62 grams I flip quick 
A brick couldn't slow me down 
Cause only I hold me down 
Now these hoes Change Faces 
They want to stroke me now 
Cause they know it's me but next move it's get O.U.T"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball, uh uh, uh uh, yeah

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, I play for me and play a whole lot more, more!
Singing about the good things and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way

I don't know, oh oh, yeah'

Ooh, yeah

Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing about the mountains but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

Oh yeah!

It sure is fine!
Ah blow my mind!
When the tears are goin' down! 
Yeah! Yeah, yeah

Oh so, oh so, oh so good!
Oh so good!Get away, let's leave today, let's get away! 
So you say you've tried but just can't find the measure
People around you are giving you pressure
Try to resist, all the bad things all around you
If you taste them, they will haunt you
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah, get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
What ya, what ya, what ya, what ya know?
Watch all the stars, they lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can. I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah. Get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
Let's leave today, let's get away

There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick

I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Someone will get me and take me away!

I'm gonna leave you baby, goin' down to Steamboat Tennessee,

I'm gonna keep that time from comin' if I can!

Folks up here say I'm strange and queer,

Don't have to be no fortune teller to read what's on any man's mind,
And I'm glad to be goin', and I ain't leavin' too much behind!

And I'm glad to be goin', and I ain't leavin' too much behind!When the lights go out and the mercury rises
Angels fall to the other side
Fear meets lust just us colliding
When the lights go out we own the night

Blood red pumps up against your body
Beating like drums sucked in the fire
Wrong feels right don't try to fight it
'Cause the night dissolves into desire

When the light go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go out

Now I lay you down but no ones sleeping
Now I lay you down here in the dark

Lights go out to shouts and screaming
No one gets out without a scar

When the lights go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go out

I can feel it coming
Feel your body humming
Pushing buttons when the lights go, lights go

I can feel it coming
Feel your body humming
Self destructing when the lights go, lights go

When the lights go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go

When the lights go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go out
When the lights go outNow, when I just was a little boy
Standin' to my Daddy's knee
My poppa said "Son, don't let the man get you
And do what he done to me"

[Chorus:]
I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou

Wish I was back on the Bayou
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I where a fast freight train
Just a chooglin' on down to New Orleans

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou

[Chorus]

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the BayouClouds roll by as I look to the sky
And then the feeling comes, it comes on again
You know desire burns like a fire, fire of sin
Oh, will I ever learn
You're the only one I could call my own
But then the shadows fall and I'm gone again

I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for things
That I might never find again

Care for you, you know that I always will
I know it's hard for you, my taste for the kill
But then it calls to me when the moon rises full in the sky
You know it's not denied
Will I ever find love and peace of mind
On these streets again, will it ever end

I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for things
That I might never find again

You know desire burns like a fire, fire within
I guess I'll never learn
You're the only one I could call my own
But when the shadows fall, you know I won't be home

I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for the things
That I might never find again

I'm a hunter
Searching for love
I'm the hunter
Searching for the things
That I might never find again.On the wings of an angel flying

Be a shooting star
Don't look back for a single minute

Once again were gonna pump it

I've been waiting for this moment all my life
But it's not quite right

And this real
It's impossible if possible
At whose blind word
So clear but so unheard

I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this silence all night long
It's just a matter of time

To appear sad
With the same old decent lazy eye
Fixed to rest on you
Aim free and so untrue

Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Lost and loaded
Still the same old decent lazy eye
Straight through your gaze
That's why I said I relate
I said we relate
It's so fun to relate

It's the room, the sun, and the sky
The room, the sun, and the sky

I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this momentFirst the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms
 
First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your armsA child in a curious phase 
A man with sullen ways 
Oh, I know very well how I got my name 

You think you were my first love 
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong 
You were the only one 
Who's come and gone 

When thirteen years old 
Who dyed his hair gold ? 
Oh, I know very well, I don't need to be told 

You think you were my first love 
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong 
You were the only one 
Who's come and gone 

You were the only one 
Who's come and goneRemember those walls I built
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

I can see your halo (halo) haloWhen I was a curly headed baby
My daddy sat me down on his knee
He said, "Go to school and learn your letters
Don't you be a dirty coal miner like me"

[Chorus: ]
I was born and raised in the mouth of the Hazard Hollow
Coal cars rumbled past my door
Now they're standin' in a rusty row all empty
And the L & N
Don't stop here anymore

I used to think my daddy was a black man
With script enough to buy the company store
Now he goes town with empty pockets
And his face is white as a February snow

[Chorus: ]
Well I'd never thought I'd learn to love the coal dust
Never thought I'd pray to hear that whistle roar
Oh God, I wish the grass would turn to money
And those greenbacks fill my pockets up once more

[Chorus: ]

Last night I dreamed I went down to the coal yard
To draw my pay like I'd done before
Them kudzu vines are covering all the windows
There were leaves and grass growin' right up through the floor

[Chorus: ]Right of the rip, nobody could f*ck with me
I'm out of space, mind and body 
My soul and so on (so on)
Mami, I'm fly is an understatement
Come to greatness

I'm on my own planet
I'll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back (for doing good)
I don't need nobody else
I'm gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts (it's all good)

Right of the rip nobody is quite like me
You gon' need a NASA spacecraft to sight me
If you don't like me, bite me
I could give a f*ck, less fightin' excites me
Leanin' on the moon with a Patron fifth playin' my own shit
And I sound terrific
I'm not cocky, I'm beyond that
It's time to start another hobby, I'm beyond rap
Run and tell your baby daddy and your son Ray
I'm hot, I sunbathe on the sun babe
I'm the one on the one way
Head and pretty long legs from the runway
My nigga Notty is a genius
You gonna need a ladder just to climb on my penis
Got two words for the rap game
F*ck y'all 

I'm on my own planet
I'll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back (for doing good)
I don't need nobody else
I'm gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts (it's all good)

Right off the rip, you thought it was a rap for me
Didn't you? Go on 'head and admit it hater
Cold as ice I'm a living refrigerator
The reason hip-hop's breathin', the defibrillator
I did a bid just for drunk drivin'
It'll never happen again 'cause now I'm drunk flyin'
I'm an innovator
When I say I'm on Venus I don't mean that I'm datin' a tennis player
I'm on Saturn where you don't matter
Alone, I'm past the zone where your phone scatters
Hello? Can you hear me now you? 
You don't got a f*ckin' choice
Elbowed my way into everybody's conversations
With rhymin', timin', and patience
Now I'm in space bitch
I use to have to be on some watch what I say shit
But now you gotta take it!

I'm on my own planet
I'll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back (for doing good)
I don't need nobody else
I'm gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts (it's all good)

They say a closed mouth don't get fed
I say a closed mouth don't give head
On the flip side, know a closed fist don't get bread
And if you swing it then you gon' get lead
Boy I put 'em in a panic, got 'em all frantic
Overlook my antics, you'll see that I'm a throwback
Hip hop Stan Smith, but it lessen my love
'Cause the so-called rulers ain't quite measuring up
Now let me give the chicks a message
Bitter exes'll tell you that the dick is precious
Three words, get over it
And if you speak mine, mention I could trip over it
Low key like my name too big for the bill
Betty White style, get it in, still
Plus I'm on the high you can't fit in the pill
But I try anyway, we gon' die anyway, ya heard

I'm on my own planet
I'll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back (for doing good)
I don't need nobody else
I'm gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts (it's all good, it's all good)Oh whoa

Every man deserves to earn 
Jah Jah come and plant with success 
Holding firm 
Every man deserves to earn
Every man has his turn 
You won't sink I in the mess"Clang, clang, clang" went the trolley
"Ding, ding, ding" went the bell
"Zing, zing, zing" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
"Chug, chug, chug" went the motor
"Bump, bump, bump" went the brake
"Thump, thump, thump" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

"Buzz, buzz, buzz" went the buzzer
"Plop, plop, plop" went the wheels
"Stop, stop, stop" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the lineSome of these days
You'll miss your honey
Some of these days
You'll feel so lonely

You'll miss my hugging
You'll miss my kisses
You'll miss me, honey
When you go away

I feel so lonely
Just for you only
For you know, honey
You've had your way

And when you leave me
I know you'll grieve me
You'll miss your little honey

PapapappaYou know its all a game.
That we play back and forth.
I leave. You chase.
And were back to square one.
We were not mean to be.
And I tried my best to work it through.
I asked my friends "what should I do?"
There only advice was leaving you.
But I'm glad I did.
Or at least that's what I tell myself.
I swear to god I never would of known
Your face or your name.
If everyday is a constant reminder your a
Whore,liar,ghost,harlot.
And its sad to say, that
I still cry to the Bayside CD everyday.
Don't you know that those songs are about you?
Check tracks 8 and 9.
Then call me back.
You ask me "when is it over?"
Over? This isn't over till I say its over.
Back to Square one.
Come On
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life

Walking through time
Looking for an answer
How can it be this way? 
What have I done?
I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change

[Bridge]
'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along, know
After this love is found
It seems like we can't go wrong

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew
I'll never let go, cause I love you so
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life
(uh huh)
(oh yeah)

Some people search
What seems to be a lifetime
To find a love like this (oh yeah)
And here we are
With everything we've wished for
I've never felt such bliss (oh no)

'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along
After this love is found

[Chorus]

There comes a chance 
In everyone's life
And I believe it won't happen twice
Now since I've felt the glory of love
I want to spend forever
And ever with you

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart I know there's only you (only you)
And right from the start I always knew
I'll never let go, cause I love you so (I love you so)
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life

Deep in my heart I know there's only you (only you, only you, oh oh)

Oh, I want you for the rest of my life
I want your love forever

Oh, I want you for the rest of my lifeHolding nothing
Scratch the walls just to survive
You can't fathom what that's like
You can listen to you lies
In the end you'll do your time

Holding nothing
Staring at myself again
What I see would swallow you
In your eyes I'll always be nothing

Never did you understand
Never did you give respect
Never did you ever love
Never
NeverThere's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say. "Brandy, fetch another round"
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes 
Could steal a sailor from the sea"

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved

He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailor said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea"

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, yes, it is"

He said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is"Black pontiac with a pocket of cash

She said I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going quite like you do when you do the things you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town something to talk about

We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn't want it to end
So we went

Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancin'
Did't take long, just a couple of songs
You know it's last call when the law comes walkin' in

So we were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn't want it to end
So we went

Rocking to the radio, fogging up the windows
Headlights off in a spot nobody else knows

Of grass and trees
And see ground kissed
By honey bees
Like way back home, now

Oh, but childhood days
Are dead 'n gone
Well, but the memories
Still linger on

Oh, have you ever gone swimmin'
In a muddy creek
With nothin' on your body
From head to feet?
Way back home, yeah

How you play for the game
Like hide an seek
Yeah!
And snk through the weeds
Overhear the streams

Well, I know some kids
Still play those games
But when they play
It just ain't the same

Done ever'thing that a man can do
Ever'thing to get a hold on you
Done everything that a man can do
Everything to get a hold on you

I've been blessed and I've been cursed
All my lies have been unrehearsed
All of the fire that I walked through
Only times to get a hold on you

Only tryin' to get a hold on you
All the fire that I walked through
Only tryin' to get a hold on you

I saw you waiting at the gate
But I arrived a moment late
I saw you shed a single tear
Still I can't get there from here

I've been high and I been low

When I'm with you I believe
That your love is true
When we love you turn me out
You know what to do
Visions really blow my mind fantasizing all the time

When your body's next to me I begin to sweat
When we touch I lose control
Now you know what's next
Fantasizing all the time move your body next to mine
Well I need your love

[Repeats]
Hey-yeah, hey-yeahThere's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows

There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love

And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams
All their love

There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your armsNight and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravanIf you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kissMy heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soulLike the legend of the phoenix

Willie said "papa, don't put me down
Been doin' that hand jive all over town"

Hand jive, hand jive
Hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive

Mama, mama, look at uncle Joe, look at him
He's doin' that hand jive with sister Flo
Even gave baby sister a dime, hey, hey
Said "do that hand jive one more time"

Well, a doctor and a lawyer and a indian chief
They all dig that crazy beat
Way-Out Willie gave them all a treat, yeah
When he did the hand jive with his feet

Hand jive, hand jive
Hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive, hey, hey
Come on, sugar, yeah!

Well, Willie and Billie got married last fall
They had a little Willie Junior and that ain't all
You know that baby got greatness and it's plain to see, hey, hey
Doin' that hand jive on T.V., come on

Hand jive, hand jive
(Why don't you) hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive

Hey, hey, well
Yeah, yeahWhere we start is where we end
We step out sweetly, nothing planned
Along by the river we feed bread to the swans
And then over the footbridge to the woods beyond

We walk ourselves weary, you and I
There's just this moment

I light a campfire away from the path
We lie in the bluebells, a woodpecker laughs

Time passes slowly our hearts entwined
All of the dark times left behind

The day is done
The sun sinks low
We fold up the blanket, it's time to go

We walk ourselves weary, arm in arm
Back through the twilight
Home again

We waltz in the moonlight and the embers glow
So much behind us
Still far to goInner deformity, such a foul deceptive rot.
Conceiving the grotesque. Nothing is but what is not.
Screeds of verbiage, never explained. Gazing at the flames.
Inside the dungeon or my skull, only mawkish thoughts remains.
Grotesque addict, forever shadowed,
Darkness clouding me. Absurdity now fate.
Bizzarre dreams, an horrendous nightmare,
Nothing left but to hallucinate.
Dementia reigns, a predilection. Total order cease.
Rescrudescent, this condition. Coherency decrease.
Humanity is not to shine, in my bloodless face.
Magnified in travesty, I have been displaced.
See with the eye of the mind. That the lie will speak.
Traumatic cracks in my addiction, made the future bleak.
Paralysed to ruminate, embolismic bitter jest.
Ontologically I'm dead, reborn as the grotesque.
THE GROTESQUE!
And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.Paresseuse

You make me feel like I don't need another
Come on baby let's pull back the covers
And do our best to help one another

You got me scorched where I'd forgotten there was fire

Quindi non attacca
Ti butta la coperta corta, dietro questa faccia lacrime ghiacciate.
Tu mi regali baci che cadono giù come stelle che non si tengono più

Sono solo quello che resta di me.
Senza lei non c'è, niente da perdere.
Non ho più lacrime. Ora nel cuore, è dicembre.
Niente da perdere, né da pretendere.
Ora nel cuore, è dicembre.

La terra è in fiamme, siamo braccia e gambe.
Fuggi tra le onde, fiumi senza sponde.
Le unghie stringono ferite, ma non sanno niente.
Il cuore si nasconde.

Tu stai cercando quello che io non ho più,
per riempire le mani ma non basterà.
Strappa quello che resta di me, se ti va.
L'amore non ha niente da perdere, non ho più lacrime.

Ora nel cuore è dicembre.
Niente da perdere, né da pretendere.
Ora nel cuore, è dicembre.

Ma tu chiedi di più, di una carezza.
Chiedi di più della mia assenza.
E poi, non lo dare a me tutto il bene che hai.
Chiedilo perché non lo ridarei mai.

Pensa prima a te, pensa prima a te
Che per me non c'è, che per me non c'è.
Pensa prima a te, pensa prima a te
Che per me non c'è niente da perdere, non ho più lacrime.
Ora nel cuore, è dicembre.
Niente da perdere, né da pretendere,
È solamente dicembre.This is fay in the morning ride,

Really reaching out for the other side? 
I maybe climbing on rainbows 
But, baby here goes. 

Dreams there for those who sleep, 
Life is for us to keep, 
And if you're wond'ring 
What this song is leading to 

I want to make it with you
(We can make it if we try) 
I really think that we can make it girl. 
No, you don't know me well, 

'N' ev'ry little thing only time will tell, 
But you believe the things that I do. 
And we'll see it through.

I'd like to help me through, 
I'd like to make it with you 
I really think that we can make it girlIf you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in a summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away
Ne me quitte pas
If you go away
Ne me quitte pas

But if you stay I'll make you a day like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun
We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees
And worship the wind
Then if you go I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away
If you go away
Ne me quitte pas
If you go away

If you go away as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning till
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you
Can I tell you now as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til your next hello
Ne me quitte pas
If you go away
If you go away

But if you stay I'll make you a night like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much
Then if you go I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to hold up my hand
If you go away
If you go away
Ne me quitte pas
If you go away

If you go away as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in this world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your dog
If I thought it'd have kept me by your side
If you go away
Ne me quitte pas
If you go away

Yeah, yeah, baby now
Oooh She was born fat to believe to be wed
Is a blessing with doubt without believe
Matrimony, so phony
Her up bringing real gloomy
Like a church mouth to his pouch
Before filling a duty
Counting out to all around
Left room shadow
When thoughts about pout
Outlays with sulk
In disgust she's filled with void
She said 

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Rings are gold and funds are mould
The story turns all to inconsistent, so bold
Now rise and unfold
All awhile I focus in the fiftieth mid
Wrapped to a person that could
Only be my dad
Mom's bliss's a chocolate but
Versus regret
She said, she said 

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

The girls next door
Slaves to explore
Gets more than she's looking for
Adventure k.o. no quid pro quo's
Gonna make her feel down and low
What a faint make up
(It's) Hard to keep the face up
Many partners come and go
Before she wakes up
Those who stay
Make it tempo-free
Made a wish she said
If you buy yesterday
Who's faster, faster each day
And I stay on her finest array
Then I heard her say
I heard her say

Zerotonine, I'm in line, to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Talked to the one who had no fun
From the day of their own prom
Hide behind quibbler lunch
Heard the one of great importance

Zerotonine, I'm in line, to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Zerotonine, I'm in line, to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blindSo hold your head up high
And know it's not the end of the road
Walk down this beaten path before you
Pack your things and head home
At the end of the road
You'll find what you've been looking for

I know 'cause my feet have the scars to show
I was lost with vague direction
And no place to call home

It's time for you to press on
This is not your war
Set your sights to North and press on
This is not your escape
Wash away what they thought of you
Because in this place, we're all as good as dead
...End cycle...

Behind the mask you'll find yourself alone
It's not the end of road for youThis song goes out to those with coke bottle glasses 
To all you lonely kids who were the last pick in gym classes 
We got your back - detract your malefactors 
All you up in the back unite like Thundercats 
Get up, get up, 'cause we're fed up, fed up 
Try to rise and keep your head up, head up 
Leave the kinging to Kong, we'll be singing our song 
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
It's a sentimental journey 
Presenting sentiments of resentment that would burn me 
Unearthing archives of sharp knives turning blunt 
My road is to unfold, so I gotta face the front 
I used to spend my days dazed and confused 
16 year underdog still donning Under-roos 
Sorry Busta, I know my flow sounds used 
Written and directed by the likes of John Hughes 
Recycled recitals of rewritten idylls 
Are scrawled in the hall like Anthony Michael 
I lack land and title, just one of the boys 
On islands and islands of misfit toys 
CHORUS

My field of dreams was a parking lot 
With hot shots doing donuts and pissin' off the grown-ups 
Me on the side writing unrequited love letters 
That I would send to my imaginary girlfriend 
I had to pretend 'cause I never played football 
The kid drafted last pick at the roll call 
To ease the monotony of everybody mockin me 
I spent time to tend rhymes like botany 
Now what I want to be? What you want to be? 
Maybe famous, I claim this, try to gain this 
But sometimes it's heinous the way the shameless 
Surround me like a tide and drown me 
So I'm looking for intelligent life forms 
I'm looking for a blip on the screen 
So I can reach out and touch somebody, anybody 
Everybody

Oooo Wah Oooo Wah Oooo Wah, Oooo Oooo Oooo OoooIf it matters how you do it
And how you do it 
It's your thing
If it matters which way you go
That's your way to go
And if you get it like that
That's the way you get it
'Cause you get it like that when you want to be that way
When you want to be that way
That's the way you want to be, see

Hey! It's all right
Hey! Ah, it's all right

Now that you try to do to me
Out there walkin' doesn't matter, baby
Ain't no question, no suggestion
Nothin' in my mind that can't be
Shut out when I want it to be
Nothin' in yours that can't be kept in
When you open it up and lose it
And nothin' you can't let out
If it's got to be let out, just let it out
And don't worry which way it goes

Hey! It's all right
Hey! Ah, it's all right

Now how can I tell you that I love you
How can I say so many words and so many syllables
In such a short space of time as this
Just turn it on and soak it in
And let it run off the walls
And let it down, keep it, and don't lose it
Or confuse it
It's just right there layin' open
Completely open for everybody to see
Yeah, you got it

Hey! It's all right
Hey! Ah, it's all rightMoving away, crazy days to leave
I'll always be an alarmist
Who'd jump at a chance
Anything for romance
I hope I'll always be what you want

Moving away
Those I'll miss
Those I won't
But I hope your heart will beat where my home is

A new life to create
A new life to create

Don't know quite why
But I was feeling unsatisfied
I had to get out now
Trying to find it

Possessed by your love
Under the influence
And though there's a new life line
I won't forget the one I left behind

A new life to create
A new life to create
A new little lifeHere we go go! 
You better listen
The b-b-b train is riding on a rhythm
We know they're hungry so we better feed them
Skip the bullshit and give some of oh! 

Pick up your clapping hands and pay attention
From the middle east to the open nations
We're coming straight to your ears no complications
Az yalla yalla (so c'mon c'mon) come on give me some of oh! 

Give me give me some of oh!

Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel?
Will I dance for You, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still?
Will I stand in Your presence? To my knees will I fall?
Will I sing Hallelujah? Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine, I can only imagine

Bien sûr s'est dur d'être heureux
Le bonheur se cache souvent
Ne nous effleure que quand il veut
Peut-être parce qu'il est méfiant
Peureux, craintif ou défaillant
Preneur de tangentes et déviant
Qu'il nous compisse d'un jet tournant
C'est vrai, c'est vrai
Le bonheur, hum s'il vous plaît

Bien sûr on s'cache pour pleurer
Bien sûr rien n'est moins sûr que la vérité
Elle assassine sans tuer
Et laisse à vif, écorché
Y'a trop d'froideur dans trop d'foyers
Tant d'bassesses et d'aigreurs pour nous fourvoyer
Peut-être qu'on fuit la vérité
C'est vrai, c'est vrai
La vérité, la vérité

Bien sûr la vie est hasardeuse
Tellement trop courte et capricieuse
Injuste, odorante et visqueuse
C'est peut-être une auto-stoppeuse
Déroutante excitante farfelue et farceuse
Jonchée d'épines et de courbes délicieuses
Peut-être même que c'est une chieuse
C'est vrai, c'est vrai
Bien sûr que la vie est précieuse

Bien sûr être seul c'est rude
Bien sûr à deux on est plus fort
Bien sûr que j'y crois encore
Bien sûr que l'amour est plus fort que la mort
Y'a des doutes et des gouttes qui perlent sur nos fronts
Des certitudes écœurantes qui nous plombent vers le fond
Peut-être qu'on est des bouffons
C'est vrai, c'est vrai
Mais je n'veux plus être un pigeon

The greatest power, love
The greatest weakness, lack of faith
The greatest certainty, change
The greatest sickness, fear
The greatest danger, ignorance
The greatest force, truth
The greatest good, peace
The greatest enemy, pride, hate, ego
The greatest victory, self controlWhen you make the music
You got to be real
And it probably feels stronger than solid steel
Stronger than doses of gamma rays
If you wanna take it the Bruce Banner way
Stronger than tsunami winds
Marine and Army men
Take the 300 from Spartan times ten
Stronger than takin’ some Jamaica rum
That’s way over proof
To make you know the truth
About the message in the music
We express it when we use it
Somethin’ to alleviate the stress for a minute
If just for a minute
To make you feel good
You wanna feel good
It’s fine with me
There's something different things it’s designed to be
Just set aside what may trouble you
Feel the power in the music from KW

People around the world
You say you want some change
So much anger all around
Are we the ones to blame
Our words cut like a knife
Words cut like a knife
Yeah
Seldom do we think
Think before we speak
So much distrust
So much disbelief
What happened to my brother
Watching over me
But then I see that there's the power of music
Speaks louder than words
The power of music
You hear it all around the world
The power of music
It’s fueling the soul
Hear it and know
Hey that's the power of music

The suits just keep on talking
Change is on the way
But they don't speak to me now
With anything they say
My melody it helps me keep my sanity
Keep my sanity
We got a common thread now
The words are in the songs
When everybody sings
We know that we belong
It’s a living legacy
Here for you and me
Set it free
That's the power of music
Speaks louder than words
The power of music
Heard all around the world
Yeah
The power of music
It’s fueling my soul
You hear it and know
You got the power of music

I wanna hear it now
I wanna sing it
I wanna live it
That's my song
Hey it’s where I belong
That's my music
And I got the power
Sing it strong now
We got the power
The power of music

In Cuba each merry maid wakes up with this serenade
Peanuts (they're nice and hot)
Peanuts (he sells a lot)
Peanuts

If you haven't got bananas don't be blue
Peanuts in a little bag are calling you
Don't waste them (no tummy ache)
You'll taste them (when you're awake)
For at the very break of day
The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning the whistle blows
(through every city, town and country lane
You hear him sing his plaintive little strain)
And as he goes by to you he'll say
(Big jumbos) big jumbo ones
(Come buy those) peanuts roasted today
(Come buy those freshly roasted today)

If you're looking for a moral to this song
50 million monkeys can't be wrong

(In Cuba his smiling face is welcome most anyplace)
(Peanuts they hear him cry)
(Peanuts they all reply)
(If you're looking for an early morning treat)
(Get some double jointed peanuts good to eat)
For breakfast (or dinnertime)
For supper (most anytime)
The merry twinkle in his eye
He's got a way that makes you buy
(Each morning) that whistle blows
(Are you more than I sell)

If an apple keeps the doctor from your door
Peanuts ought to keep him from you even more
(Peanuts) we'll meet again
This street again
We'll eat again
You Peanut Man, that peanut man's gone
(Peanut, peanut, peanut)I know we'll do it again
I know we're going to collide
I know we'll call it the end
It's always, always a lie
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I wear my blood on my tie
But it's only love underneath this disguise

Oh you left a hole in me
But I don't cut easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
Think it's time to open up
I don't mean bleed

So turn it on
We can go wild if it's what you want
Fire at me

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go

Why don't you do it again?
Go wrecking something of mine
Like you deserve the revenge
Like I've got something to hide
I'll keep on playing with you
You keep on calling me names
Sure, I can take the abuse
It's just a game

Oh you left a hole in me
But I don't cut easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
Think it's time to open up

So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go

All I know is I love it when our shit blows
We keep turning red hot and stone cold
Sweet burn inside, deals get broke
We fall in and fall out
We're too close, it's dead love
Until curtains close and we come alive

I can't bear to let you go, no
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you 

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life

It's just a lonely night
Tonight

I walked from the bar
'Cause they were only laughing
I wished on our star
But they covered it in satin
I'm not a gigolo
That's what I want you to know
Tonight

Ooh ooh

You'll meet other men
Who will break your heart
If I see you with them
It's gonna tear me apart

Maybe in another life
We wouldn't be alone

In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to loveI want you so hard
I want you so good

I just needed to remember
What your love has meant to me
You get all the good things
In this life for free
And you're still the best thing
That ever happened to me

It's five in the morning
You're still inside my head
Walking the road we both know so well
And it's never easy
To go back to where you were
Still tempted by all the things

We left here for

I just needed to remember
What your love has done to me
You get all the good things
In this life for free
And you're still the best thing
That ever happened to me

I'll sing you my life
With every breath I take
I'll reach out for you
Each morning when I awake

I just needed to remember
What your love has meant to me
You get all the best things
In this life for free
And you're still the best thing
That ever happened to meWe were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,

She shook it so much she had the German flu

(chorus:)
No matter how she done it, 
No matter how she done it,
No matter how she done it,
She done it just the same

The women don't like her, they call her Ida Mae
But the way the men love her is a cryin' shame

(chorus)

I tell you people what she done
She made a hit with Jack the Ripper, and the only one

(chorus)

You women don't have to worry 'bout your life
She made Jack the Ripper throw away his knife

She shakes all over when she walks
She made a blind man see, and a dumb man talk

(chorus)

The copper brought her in, she didn't need no bail
She shook it for the judge, and put the cop in jail

(chorus)How many times have I called you 
While you were working just to say
Left messages on your answering machine
About three or four times a day
There aren't many more ways in words that I can say
So I'll just say numerically from my heart to you - 143

So many times I've brought roses
Just to see that smile on your face
I can't remember how many e-mails I sent you
Just to tell you about my day
There aren't many more ways in words that I can say
So I'll just say numerically from my soul to you - 143

Girl you know you are so special to me
And you deserve to be treated exclusively
I treat you like Valentines Day 365 a year
Make sure that everything you need will always be right here
I just refuse to be your typical ordinary run of the mill
Garden variety lover
I'll make sure everyday you live will be like Christmas Eve
I want to make you feel fine
Just like a summer breeze
Cause I refuse to be predictable average run of the mill
Garden variety love
See sometimes words may get in the way 
Of things that you really really meant to say
So I want to out this time to make sure that how I really feel
Gets through to you
Cause listen 
There aren't many more ways and words that I can say 
So I choose to tell you how I feel in a numerical way'
Got so tired of trying to find the most complicated way
To say it to you so I simplified and broke it down 
To 143 - and that means I love youQuitame el miedo de estar solo contigo
Y decirte despacito al oido
Que te quiero mi amor, que te quiero

Y dejame decirte lo
Que siento aqui en mi corazon
Que palpita y se emociona al oir tu voz
Tan solo tu voz, tu suave voz

Tengo ganas de llenarte de caricias
Que mi deseo por besarte lleva prisa
Estoy lleno de pasion
Y quiero darte mucho amor

Pero estoy aqui solo pensando en ti
En esta oscuridad esta es mi realidad
Por no decir que te quiero hasta morir
Yo me estoy haciendo daño

Y estoy aqui, deseando tu querer
A caso tu no crees, que puedo enloquecer
Hazme feliz, ya no quiero mas sufrir
Por que yo te estoy amando

There should be no hesitation when the coast is clear 
You got a right to slide right into place when the end is almost here 
So you think you got some rotten deal 
What a way to compromise 

It's a long long way before you get to claim that final prize 
Looking at that sorry face i can recognize the fear 
But if you keep on looking up at night the stars will all appear 
See there's food for me, there's food for you 

There's gold that's in the air 
There's oceans deep and wide and there is love beyond compare 
There's apple in the trees 
Let's take all that we need 

We know what we believe 
There's hope for you and me 
My eyes can almost see 
If you fight 'til you're free 

You don't have to wait until you dieWhenever she is weary 
She climbs uphill 
And crosses a dark trail 
And there she finds the fox in the wooden glade 
She lies by a rock and she's red 
She smells of violets and ?
She flicks her ears 
As I whisper 

I've grown a handsome tall tree, mother 
And I want to bear a fruit for you 
And I've carried your fears and your hopes, father 
They're so heavy on my back, oh you should know 

Catch some sleep 

I wanna find the eagle's nest 
Oh take me with you (oh, oh) 
Oh, and I've been waiting a lifetime for this 
And I am ready (oh, oh) 
Oh, best believe me I've been up all night 
They call me crazy (ooh, ooh) 
But I wanna see what the sky looks like 
From your view (uh oh, uh oh, whoa) 

But I saw 
Your face carved in clay 
And I saw (she saw) 
It outlined against a purple sky 
It goes loud and deep in me 
Loud and deep 
My home 
Is on that cliff 

I wanna find the eagle's nest 
Oh take me with you (oh, oh) 
Oh, I've been waiting a lifetime for this 
And I am ready (uh oh, uh oh) 
Whoa, forever wanderer, I wandered all my life 
They never knew me (no, no) 
Oh, I wanna see what the sky looks like 
From your view (uh oh, uh oh, whoa)

And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Rolling down the highway in my Jimmy hauling freight

From Chicago to St Louis Lord I see her every day

A double clutching weasel like me can hardly ever get a girl to look at him that way

Like the girl wearing nothing but a smile

And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway



Well what a girl wearing nothing but a smile

And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

I bet it wouldn't take her very long to be gone

If someone would pull a dirty trick and take her hot pants away

I slow my Jimmy down to twenty that's how many wrecks I see there every day

Caused by the girl wearing nothing but a smile

Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
No no no no
Don't cry, don't cry

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by, I know, don't cry

Summertime, summertime, summertime
And the living is, living is easy
Fish are, I know the fish are jumping
And cotton is so high
Your daddy is so, so rich and your mama good-
She had to be good-looking
So hush, little baby, don't you cry
Don't you cry, no no, don't cry
No need to cry, don't cry, don't cry

Down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
I said, 'I'm beggin' for mercy, [Incomprehensible] if you please?"

I went down to the crossroads, tried to beg a ride
Down to the crossroads, tried to beg a ride
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by
I wanna take a ride

Going down to Rosedale, take [Incomprehensible] by my side
Going down to Rosedale, take [Incomprehensible] by my side

You can run, you can run, tell my friends I'll be by
And I'm standing at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking downWild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything groovy
Wild thing
Wild thing, I think I love you
But I wanna know for sure
Come on and hold me tight
I love you

Wild thing
Oh, come on, wild thing
Shake it, shake it, wild thingI can't hold you like I want to
Can't hold you to the promises you make
You won't be here tonight or any other night

It would be a lie to say I'm not afraid
But to be afraid is something that I've always been
The difference is this time I'm not giving in

Yes, I am alone, yes, I'm on my own
But for the first time in my life
I'm gonna carry on, yes, I'm gonna ache

But I will not break, some things I can choose
And baby I refuse to be lonely to be lonely
I can't change you, I can't blame you

And this time, I'm not even gonna try
You do what you have to do
I'll do the same thing too

You've got a right to say good-bye
But I've got a right to take care of myself
I realize that I come first before anyone else

Yes, I am alone, yes, I'm on my own
But for the time in my life
I'm gonna carry on, yes, I'm gonna ache

But I will not break, some things I can choose
And baby, I refuse to be lonely
Lonely is a place I used to be
But I'm closing that door, I won't live there anymore

Yes, I am alone, yes, I'm on my own
But for the first time in my life
I'm gonna carry on, yes, I'm gonna ache

But I will not break, some things I can choose
And baby, I refuse to be lonely
To be lonely, to be lonely
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San AntoneÔ ariá aio oba oba oba

[Chorus:]
Running just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doin'
'cause what would they say
If they ever knew
And so we're

[Repeat chorus]
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only soundI'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around

For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you lovedI couldn't stop movin' when it first took hold
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall
There was a group called The Jokers, they were layin' it down

But we got one more night
Let's get drunk and drive around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side
But we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young
And we'll feel so alive

Throw it away
Forget yesterday

We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway

All of the wasted time
The hours that were left behind
The answers that we'll never find
They don't mean a thing tonight

Throw it away

'Cause we are finally free tonightOne day as i walked with my son hand in hand,
He said, there are things that i don't understand,
How high is the sky? what makes it so blue?
And tell me, dad, what does god look like to you?

I said, he looks like a rainbow, just after the rain,
He's as golden as wheat dancing over the plain.
He looks like the star when the night's crystal clear,
He looks like a baby when mother is near.

His face is the moonlight reflected on snow,
His hair like garden where all flowers grow,
He's heavenly eyes are as true as the sea,
My son, that's what god really looks like.

His heart like a mountain so vast and so strong,
That's why all his children have room to belong.
His smile is the morning we waken to see,
But you, my son, you are what god really looks like to me.Oh, never mind, we tried
We loved
We conquered, I won't forget
The taste
Oh, no

I'll never say never again
I'll never say never
I'll never say never again
I'll never say never
I'll never say never again

The music brings me right back
And you know that
And you know that
I got the answers in me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

Like a vision of love
You came, you stood
You blew right through me
I have no regrets
The tears, the hopes

I'll never say never again
I'll never say never
I'll never say never again
I'll never say never
I'll never say never again

The music brings me right back

It's like I hear an angel calling
The musicSavoy, the home of sweet romance
Savoy, it wins you at a glance
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Your form, just like a clingin' vine
Your lips, as warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singin'
While the band is swingin'
Never tired of rompin'
An' Stompin' with you at the Savoy

What joy, a perfect holiday
Savoy, where we can glide and sway
There let me stomp away with you

Savoy,

Never tired of rompin'
An' Stompin' with you at the Savoy

What joy,
Savoy,
Savoy, there let me stomp away
With you.Forward,forward, back, back, back
I've fallen and I can't get up and I'm slipping through the cracks
I'm in a crisis and I can't afford the prices
No means to feed my family, never mind the nices
No escape, no pleasure
I really can't seem to get my shit together
Can't protect my children from the weather
Me and my baby skin grows the toughest leather

Where do they go?
When it rains
Where do they go?
When it snows
Where do they go?
When the cold winds blow
Where do they go?
When we are warm behind closed doors

The children cry themselves to sleep
Another night with no food to eat
Tear soaked pillow is a step of concrete
It's enough to drive me to rob steal kill or cheat
You may ask how can you live this rigid life
No means to feed or house your babies and your wife
As I will, I sunk to depths you can't fathom
My lifes a blunder, it's no wonder why you can't imagine

Where do they go?
When it rains
Where do they go?
When it snows
Where do they go?
When the cold winds blow
Where do they go?
When we are warm behind closed doors

Dem a go back down, dem a go way out
Back to this real world we live in
Dem a too far down, dem a too far out
For the real concern we're givin'
Dem all rob and steal, shoot up and kill
Is the common misconception
We all justify, we all ease our minds
With these deceptions

Now if life was a thing that money coulda buy
Then the rich man would make war and the poor man would fight
The rich mother would pity while the poor mother would cry
While the rich make excuses and the poor people die

Type a thing make I wanna go run and hide
Back to me condo over off of Rodeo Dr.
Grab a beer, try to remember a verse from the Bible
Put on me Tivo and see who's off American Idol

Where do they go?
When it rains
Where do they go?
When it snows
Where do they go?
When the cold winds blow
Where do they go?
When we are warm behind closed doorsFolks here's a story 'bout Minnie the Moocher,

She sat around and counted them all a million times.

Sometimes I wanna give up
I wanna give in

You're my reason for livin'

But things could be worse, sure couldWe must talk on every telephone
Get eaten off the web
We must rip out all the epilogues
From the books that we have read
And to the face of every criminal
Strapped firmly to a chair
We must stare, we must stare, we must stare

We must take all of the medicine
Too expensive now to sell
Set fire to the preacher
Who is promising us hell
And in the ear of every anarchist
That sleeps but doesn't dream
We must sing, we must sing, we must sing

While my mother waters plants
My father loads his gun
He says death will give us back to god
Just like the setting sun
Its return to the lonesome ocean

And then they splashed into the deep blue sea
It was a wonderful splash

We must blend into the choir
Sing a static with the whole
We must memorize nine numbers
And deny we have a soul
And in this endless race for property
And privilege to be one
We must run, we must run, we must run

We must hang up in the belfry
Where the bats and moonlight laugh
We must stare into a crystal ball
And only see the past
And into the caverns of tomorrow
With just our flashlights and our love
We must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge
And then we'll get down there
Way down to the very bottom of everything
And then we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it

Oh my mornings coming back
The whole world's waking up
This city bus is swimming past

Spinning Wheel got to go 'round
Talkin' 'bout your troubles
It's a cryin' sin
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel spin
You got no money, you got no home
Spinning Wheel all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you
You never learn
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel turn
Did you find your directing sign 
On the straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign?
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real
Someone is waiting just for you
Spinning Wheel spinning true
Drop all you troubles by the river sideThere doesn't have to be a reason
There doesn't have to be a why
And any moment could be magical
It could be this night
You've got an energy burning like I've never seen, bringing me to life

And I can't beat the feeling that I get when I'm with you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head; I can't help but move
Two people synchronized got the power that brings you closer
I've decided I can't beat the feeling that I get when I'm with you

Feel the force of the reaction
Let it take you on a ride
And all resistance is illogical
When your love slides
We've got an energy
Fast revolving 'round our feet
Bringing us to life

And I can't beat the feeling that I get when I'm with you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head; I can't help but move
Two people synchronized got the power that brings you closer
I've decided I can't beat the feeling that I get when I'm with you

And you're wondering who to call
For a little company
There's always me

Or if your great romance should end,
And you're lonesome for a friend
Darling, you need never be
There's always me

I don't seem to mind somehow
Playing second fiddle now
Someday you'll want me, dear,
and when that day is here,
Within my arms you'll come to know
Other loves may come and go
But my love for you will be eternally
Look around and you will see
There's always me.IÂ´m alone and feeling lost
If I could only have it all
That IÂ´ll be alright
'Cause I canÂ´t see who I really am
YouÂ´re the doom the IÂ´m living in
But I know again
Right before I hit the ground

[Chorus] 
Why am I losing sleep?
Yeah, feeling like I do
Why am I losing you?
And IÂ´m feeling lost

Is a dark cloud over me
And I canÂ´t shake it of I canÂ´t
Make a move till I see myself
Thoughts keeps spinning through my head
All the times that we never dared
What we wanted do, yeah
Right before I hit the ground
Is just like a dream

[Chorus]

Distance grows, IÂ´m sinking down
What IÂ´ve lost canÂ´t be found
Although IÂ´ll tried canÂ´t found me way
NothingÂ´s falling into place

IÂ´m feeling lost
IÂ´m feeling, IÂ´m feeling lost, yeah
Is just like a dream

[Chorus: x2]Your admirers on the street
Got to hoot and stamp their feet
In the heat from your physique
As you twinkle by mocassin sneakers
And I thought my heart would break
When you doubled up the stake
With your fingers all a shake
You could never tell a winner from a snake

Easy Money

With your figure and your face
Strutting out at every race
Throw a glass around the place
Show the colour of your crimson suspenders
We would take the money home
Sit around the family throne
My old dog could chew his bone
For two weeks we could appease the Almighty

Easy Money

Your admirers in the street
Got to hoot and stamp their feet
In the heat from your physique
As you twinkle by in moccasin sneakers
Got no truck with the la-di-da
Keep my bread in an old fruit jar
Drive you out in a motor-car
Getting fat on your lucky star

Just making easy moneyThey can come take it all away 
Break you heart by the light of day 
Drown your love in a distant bay so lonely 

See the ships heading for the rocks 
See the time melting over the clocks 
There's a light shadows all 
The rocks that saves me 
It saves me 

That's why I wander and follow La Vie Dansante 
On the night wind that takes me 
Just where I want 
That's all I want 
La Vie Dansante 

Miss the beat if you close your eyes 
Every night wears a new disguise 
And I live when a new surprise surrenders 

Feel it all with a willing heart 
Every stop, there's a place to start 
If you know how to play the part with feeling 
I play with feeling 

Why don't you wander and follow La Vie Dansante 
On the night wind that takes you 
Just where you want 
That's all you want 

La Vie Dansante 

That's why I wander and follow La Vie Dansante 
On the night wind that takes me

Why you ramble, no one knows
Wild and wind blown, that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

Ramble on, ramble on
When your ramblin' days are gone
Who will love you with a love true
When your ramblin' days are gone?

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?Lost and alone in this city of darkness
Empty of lovers and full of lies
You build a wall between your dreams and the madness
I reach out my hand but you run and hide
I've watched you cry in the rain
I wanna bring back the joy again

Open your heart tomine
I believe, I believe you won't be sorry
This time - baby
Open your heart tonight
I believe, I believe you might
Be lucky this time
You might be lucky this time

No guarantees when you risk your emotion
So you surrender and it all went astray
Bitter and hopeless in your cold isolation
But you my love ever fade away
I wanna dry all your tears
You know there's nothin' to fear, baby

Open your heart tomine
I believe, I believe you won't be sorry
This time - baby
Open your heart tonight
I believe, I believe you might
Be lucky this time
You might be lucky this time

And when the shadows start to fall
Let my love break down the walls

I've watched you cry in the rain
I wanna bring back the joy again

Open your heart tomine
I believe, I believe you won't be sorry
This time - baby
Open your heart tonight
I believe, I believe you might
Be lucky this time
You might be lucky this timeIndecision, it's all upstairs
In the hide-away
In the closet
It's where you keep your clothes
Where you hide your gun
You've got no bullets
But pull the trigger for fun

Your city's sleeping
Your city's sleeping
Underneath the blankets you're still screaming
So keep it in
Hold it tight

You should let go of all that you've been thinking
It's time you realize
Or throw it all away
It's all a charade
It isn't worth it anyway
So tell your friends that you'll see them soon
If you see what everyone else sees
Whatever they say you are
That's what you'll be

Your mind is pacing
Fists clenched
Your tired fingers are searching, searching again
It makes sense
You've seen this before
In your room at night
Behind a locked door
This is not the bitter end
This is not the bitter end
This tragic story's final draft will not be handed in
So spin the record
One more time
And watch it go round and round again

It's time you realize
Or throw it all away
It's all a charade
It isn't worth it anyway
So tell your friends that you'll see them soon
If you see what everyone else sees
Whatever they say you are
That's what you'll beI love my man
I'm a liar if I say I don't
I love my man
I'm a liar if I say I don't
But I'll quit my man
I'm a liar if I say I won't

I've been your slave, baby
Ever since I've been your babe
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe
But before I'll be your dog
I'll see you in your grave

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Squawked about my supper then he put me outdoors
Had the nerve to lay a matchbox on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long ways to go

I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
But my mother, she gave me something
It's going to carry me through this world

Some men like me 'cause I'm happy
Some 'cause I'm snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I've got money

Some say me Billie
Baby, you're built for speed
Now, if you put that all together
Makes me everything a good man needsI love your world 
Where the winners might be sweet all around 
Tell me your life. 
Tell me what you'll be afraid of this night 

If you wanna take a look around 
Please don't hit a man who understands 
As the story goes you are the one 
Run away in other place 
In the night you're looking for to meet 
And checking the man to get in fit 
Just the story goes you are the one 
Run away in other place 

Yeti, yeti, yeti, yeti
Yeti, looking a horrid man. 
Yeti, living in other land

I want your soul and I really like to seem to your heart 
I feel with you and I know that you are living apart 
If you wanna take a look around... 

I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you
It's too late, too late
Baby, I know I'll never find you again
Find you again

Baby, baby, I
Walk in the late night
Looking for your eyes
Put up a fight to find you
Lose it every time
You were the last of your kind
All of the blame's mine

And I remember you told me
That we could work it all out, don't you worry
And now the tears in your eyes make it blurry
But if you say, "Try again", I'd be ready
I'm ready, yeah

I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you
It's too late, too late
Baby, I know I'll never find you again
Find you again

Have mercy on me, please
I messed up to the third degree
This crush is kind of crushing me
I do therapy at least twice a week
There's a you-shaped space in my bed
Always you-shaped thoughts inside my head, like
I keep pushing them right into you
La Cienega, where I remember you

And I remember you told me (told me)
That we could work it all out, don't you worry (yeah, yeah)
And now the tears in your eyes make it blurry (oh)
But if you say try again, I'd be ready
I'm ready

I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you
It's too late, too late
Baby, I know I'll never find you again

Find you again
Find you again
Find you again
Find you again
Find you again (it's too late)
Find you again (it's too late)
Find you again (it's too late)
Find you again (it's too late)

(Find you again) I'll try to pass the night away
(Find you again) with somebody new
(Find you again) But they don't have a shot
(Find you again) when I compare them to you
(Find you again) it's too late
Too late
Baby, I know I'll never find you again
Find you againA junkie walking through the twilight
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but noone seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it, 
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went
Home again

Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why
Hang on to your rosary beads
Close your eyes to watch me die
You keep saying, kick it, quit it, kick it, quit it
God, but did you ever try
To turn your sick soul inside out
So that the world, so that the world
Can watch you die

Home is where I live inside my white powder dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now with my
Silent screams
Home is where the needle marks
Try to heal my broken heart
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never, if I
Never went home again
Home again
Home again
Home again
Kick it, quit it
Kick it, quit it
Kick it, quit it
Kick it, can't go home againWouldn't that be fair
Wouldn't that be fair
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, okay

Baby, baby, I've got this feeling in my soul
If you don't love me would it be fair
Use my love and give yours to another
Wouldn't that be fair

I can hide all of the misery and pain
I am sure I will never love this way again
Wouldn't that be fair
Do you think she would care

Wouldn't that be fair
Wouldn't that be fair

Like the sun when it hits the urban sky at day
Lights and music takes me higher
I would love to dance my life away
Now wouldn't that be fair

Baby, baby, baby
I want, I want to, want to, want to be fair
Oh, fairplay
Oh, fairplay

Soul II Soul is the place where you should be
On Sunday night we'll expect you and Jazzie be
'Cause it's all about expression
'Cause it's all about expression

Funky people, express yourself tonight
But thinking 'loud but that's the same thing alive
'Cause it's all about expression
'Cause it's all about expression

Baby, I think you should come down
And try to express yourself, yourself

Drop me off in Harlem.

I feel like going onThe summer sun is fading as the year grows old
And darker days are drawing near
The winter winds will be much colder
Now you're not here.
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn
'Cause you're not here!I can't let go

When I'm with you I believe that your love is true
When we love you turn me out, you know what to do
Visions really blow my mind fantasizing all the time

When your body's next to me, I begin to sweat
When we touch I lose control, now you know what's next
Fantasizing all the time, move your body next to mine

That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

I tell her I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back
Up on the first flight
Right up out of town

Hop back in my spaceship
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off
'Cause I just come to take it
Then you know I gotta take off
But I'mma be here next week
So call your company and take off

And she say "Wayne you ain't shit,
You got me all impatient"
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscience while I sail off

Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And Tunechi's gon' find someone to love
And you go by yourself, so all alone

One minute she love me,
The next minute she hate me
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted
She say she, pray she, have Weezy F's baby
And I be having seizures
But she say she can't shake me
And my homies say she's cuter than my other bitches
And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom-fitted
I swear I like her more than she think I do
Girl, when I think of you
My dick just start to jumpin' like a f*cking kangaroo
I suck and f*ck and finger you
But you want me to cling to you
And I ain't asking you to change
Cause I know I can't jingle you
I got my ways
And you have your days
And we gave it our best shot
But I just got grazed
I'm sorry

Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself

And you go by yourself, so all aloneHistory is everything
Said the professor to the petitioner's girl
She, playing with her shoe,
Says I just want someone, I just want something new

I don't know what hit you
Don't care where ya been
I just know you gotta' go

Speed is everything
Said the co-pilot to the girl with the braid
She, looking round the room
Says I just want someone, I just want something new

I don't know what hit you
Don't care where ya been
I just know you gotta' go

Timing is everything
Said the conductcor to the boy half his age
He, tightening a screw,
Says I just want someone, I just want something new

I don't know what hit you
Don't care where ya been
I just know you gotta' go



Come and look out through the window
The big old moon is shinin' down
Tell me now don't it remind you
Of a blanket on the ground

Remember back when love first found us
We'd go slippin' out of town
And we'd love beneath the moonlight
On a blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walkin' once again
To the spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began

Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground

Oh, remember how excited
We used to get when love was young
That old moon was our best buddy
We couldn't wait for night to come

Now you know you still excite me
I know you love me like I am
Just once more I wish you love me
On the blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walkin' once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began

Just because we our married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the groundYou keep telling me yes
But you don't mean it
You keep telling me no
And try to lean it
You're giving me buts and maybe
You know this will drive me crazy
Why can't you tell it like it is

Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Becuse I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be no

You wear a plastic smile
I know by you eyes
You speak with indefinite style
You're telling me lies
You've got to face reality
What is wrong with you and me
Why can't you free your honesty

Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Becuse I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be noThis is not gonna last forever
It's that time when you must hold on.
And I won't let you surrender,
And I'll heal you if you're broken.

We can stand so tall together.
We can make it through the stormy weather.
We can go through it all together, do it all together, do it all.

I'll be your strength.
I will, I will, I will.
I'll be your strength.
Yes I will, yes I will.

I won't sleep till the sky is calmer,
Keep on searching till I find you.
And my love will be your armor,
In this battlefield around you.

Hand in hand we will walk together,
We can make it through the stormy weather.
We can break down walls together, do it all together, do it all.

I'll be your strength.
I will, I will, I will.
I'll be your strength.
Yes I will, yes I will.

Hold on, hold on.
I'll be, there soon.
So hold on, hold on,
I'll be, there soon.
So hold on, hold on,
I'll be, there soon.
So hold on, hold on,
I'll be, there

I'll be your strength.
I will, I will be.
I'll be your strength.
I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your strength.
I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your strength.
I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your strength.
I'll be strong for you
I'll be your strength.
And I'll keep strong for you.Oh if my wheel could take another turn
And if my life replaced itself again,
I wouldn't want a single thing to change.
Oh it's been good, though it's been strange.

And if my dreams were willing to come true,
Oh I would not even try to let them through.
I'm sure there's things I've missed, 
That others preached.
The goals they reached, 
They weren't for me.
Rest in peace,
Even though the worries seem to mount,
Don't let them count.
Rest in peace.

Throw all those smiles and paper miles away
You make willow pattern pictures through the rain.
And swallow when your heart begins to breathe,
Just like a bird, do what it please.

Cause I ain't gonna be here all that long
And when I'm old I want to know I sung.
If there's a road ahead, I'll jump right in.
Just got to win, this is my hymn.
Rest in peace, even though your worries seem to mount,
Don't let them count.
Rest in peace.

Game in exchange fo some cabbage. Bitch.All the kisses taste of dust here
And it's too late to change my mind
I'm still in love with the private world
Sometimes I've got to pull the blinds
Why aren't you dissolving yet?
And why's that car always there?
I got a letter from America
Somebody else lost in the glare
In this city, this city, oh
In this city, this city, oh
I'm walking through this big arena
I'm passing millions, missing some
When someone touches me like a sudden light
I think it's memory but it's still so bright 
There were always dreams of leaving
My face gets dimmer every day
When I can see myself I'm waving
I'm going back into the crowds again
In this city, this city, oh
In this city, this city, oh
In this city, this city, oh
This city, this city, ohTwo o'clock this morning
If she should come a calling
I couldn't dream of turning her away
And if it got hot and hectic
I know she'd be electric
I'd let her take her chances with me
You see, the gets what she wants

'Cause she's heart and soul
She's hot and cold
She's got it all, hot loving every night, oh
Oh

Can't you see her standing there
See how she looks, see how she cares
I let her steal the night away from me
Nine o'clock this morning
She left without a warning
I let her take advantage of me
You see, she got what she wanted

'Cause she's heart and soul

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soulMaybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to youEscúchame bien quiero hacerte un favor

Lay your head upon my pillow

Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more timeThere's a full moon over this ancient town
A clock faced the color of the sky
And every street that we walk down
Belongs to the house where my father died

Where prisoners march in luck step with each other
Reavers test the limit of their reign
Dragging their dead weight from the other
While I claim my place, center stage

I've been thrown by the thrashing of his going
Chained to his unseen stride
I've walked in luck step without knowing
My indifference, my only disguise

Now it comes through me like an injection
Anonymous pain throbbing real inside
And every pulse in my body
Belongs to the house where my father died

Won't catch his spirit in a candle
On or alive in it's guttering glow
And death comes through these streets like a scandal
Bent up and beaten, oh, a bitter body blow

And in bars and shaded back rooms
Those who can't cope just get high
But every place this drink takes me to
Belongs to the house, where my father died

And there's a full moon over this ancient town
Head lights numb the banner of the sky
Rain rages the steadings and the open ground
And I'm a child fighting shadows with tears in my eyes

And the valley cannons and thunder
Trees blow beneath the bruising of the sky
Like centuries shield the lake from my wonder
And I'm as helpless as a child hiding from life

And the face from my mind is fading
I count the wounds for the very first time
Tonight there's gonna be a reckoning
I'm entering the house where my father diedDon't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout meGroovin', on a Sunday afternoon

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of 

Groovin', down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do

I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee

Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
One o'clock to four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dream's too dry

Now, a man is born to go a-loving
A woman's born to weep and fret
And stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moody all the morning
Mourning all the night
And in between, it's nicotine
And not much hard to fight
Coffee

Feeling low as the ground
It's driving me crazy
This waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

Mmh, mmh, mmhWalked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street

They fell on their backs, and they fell on their faces

Someone to give me satisfaction
All I want to do is stick with you,'cause I love youForever I'll enjoy you undertaking
Come to see you every day now if I can
Is it not the time for everybody?
I still wake on the fields of regret

There is something to this dream we're all involved in
Can I see it, can I say it may exist
Why then don't the night show really matters
If we dwell in the fields of regret

What horror must invade the mind
When the approaching judge shall find
What sinful deeds from all mankind

With death and nature in surprise
Behold the wretched sinners rise
To meet the judge's searching eyes

And when the doomed no more can flee
From the flames of misery
Assist me while I die

Wander through those ever thoughts though if imagined
But come down on it's so easy to resist 
Rest me, hide my years upon the planet.
Sound another, no part over, won't forget
When we laugh at the fields of regret.Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atoneTsunami, drop!

Drop, nami na nami na nami na nami

Tsunami, drop!

nami na nami na nami na nami, drop!What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give

Or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie

What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in
I believe in love, Alfie

Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie

Your story's alive with hellos and goodbyes
Bright lights, first kiss and drunken nights
How I miss you

I miss you now and hey
And I can't wait another day
And hey, that crooked smile upon your face
Oh, they'll never get old
All the stories you told
From the beach to the ring
To the songs of your soul
How I miss you
I miss you now and hey

And the rain
Falling cold outside
Covered me the day you died
You could have waited one more day
I should've called
I dream of your life, the war and the fight
The music you played, the love for your wife
And I miss you

I miss you now and
Hey, I can't wait another day
And hey, that crooked smile upon your face
Oh, they'll never get old
All the stories you told
From the beach to the ring

How I miss you
And I miss you
I miss you now and hey

And I am mad at the age
That stole you away
By surviving the beach
You gave me my stay
And I understand by this that I am
All that you were was changed by the sand
But I miss you

I miss you now and

In every life
It has been said
There comes a time to join the dead
Admit there is no second chance
And join death in a final dance

Accept that it is time to wed

Do you think I'm scared
Tell me does it show

I can always hear his whispering

( towards ghosts )

There comes a time you decide
What from your life will be real
What scars you will keep alive
What you are willing to heal

But can I gamble this night
With everything that I am
And can I erase my life
Or do I stay here and be damned

All forgotten
All forgottenHello, boys and girls, my name is Fat Lip
And this is my friend, Sammy the Salmon
Today we're gonna teach you some
Fun facts about salmon and a brand new dance

Let me introduce to you a brand new dance
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance
It's not complicated, it's not too hard
You don't even have to be a hip hop star

See, anyone can do it, all you need is style
Listen up, people gang, I'm a show you how
Your hands to the side as silly as it seems
Shake your body like a salmon floating upstream

(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again

All my peeps spend part of their life
In fresh water and part of their life in salt water
Wow, very interesting
They change round a couple of days after spawning then we die

When I first did the salmon all the people just laughed
They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud
"What the f*ck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing the snap"

But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, "Yo, that nigga's killing it"
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating upstream

(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again

Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
Wow, my family also rely on ocean currents, tides
The gravitational pull of the moon

(I float upstream again)
The moon? Fish pay attention to the moon?
Wow, who knew?

Did you know
What?
That I could go to Japan and back?
You're kidding me? Amazing, Geez

Polluted water can kill both baby salmon
That are developing and the adult salmon
That are on their way to spawn

Wow, what a shame, what a shame
Hey, kids, hey give it up for Sammy the Salmon
And his amazing salmon dance
What ya say? Alright, who's hungry?We could throw these sparks around all day
'Til this fire gets hotter
We could stand right here on the river bank
Dip our toes in the water
We could sit on the fence and test the wind
Walk on the edge if jumping in
If we hesitate a moment to long
Our chance could be gone

[Chorus]
Why wait
When we can fall right now
It's love
We've been dancing around
The kind of love
People dream about
Hey-heyea

Why not
Cross over the line
I'm yours
Dont you wanna be mine
Something this good doesn't come along every day
Why wait


We could keep these words
On the tip of our tounge
Or come right out and say em
We could play these games
Play hard to get
Baby times a waistin
I'd rather be in a long slow kiss
Than having to hold my breath like this
It's a feeling I can't ignore
Can't hold it back anymore

[Chorus]

Why wait
When we can fall right now
It's love
We've been dancing around
The kind of love
People dream about
Hey-heyea

Why not
Cross over the line
I'm yours
Dont you wanna be mine
Something this good doesn't come along every day
Why wait

For the magic moment
When the stars align
Baby theres never gonna be
A more perfect time
Why wait

[Chorus]

Why wait
When we can fall right now
It's love
We've been dancing around
The kind of love
People dream about
Hey-heyea

Why not
Cross over the line
I'm yours
Dont you wanna be mine
Something this good doesn't come along every day

Something this good doesn't come along every day

Why wait

For me and you.Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen 'em both in this tourist town

Which way to go

So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico

Which road I travel
Is still a mystery to me

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.Oh! Mescalino

A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

On a picnic morning without a warning
I looked at you and somehow I knew
On a day for singing,
My heart went winging
A picnic grove was our rendezvous
You and I in the sunshine
We strolled the fields amd farms
At the last light of evening,
I held you in my arms
So when days grow stormy
And lonely for me
I just recall picnic time and you.It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

And your trousers undone
Gonna shit on the carpet

You've yet to discover
Discover the difference
The difference between

Glad I'm that glad I'm too
No I don't mind you
I'm keeping in mind
Glad I relate to you
Glad I resolve to you
AhhThere comes a time, every so often, 
When the Dark Carnival begins to swell with the countless souls awaiting judgement
And the thriving mob begins to tear at each other to find a place in lines that stretch out of view
And as attractions open wide to accommodate crowds frantically clawing their way inside
He will come to perform the cleansing 
As the seething masses turn to witness him growing near
Their eyes attempt to make out his face forming within the looming smoke
Suddenly, bang! Like a continuous explosion, he moves down upon them full of thunderous fury,
Enveloping the masses in darkness
Then, pow! A deep, resonating explosion of unparalleled intensity
Those still alive begin to feel a warm rain upon their charred skin, 
Which they soon realize is the blood of the shredded victims
They can only lay screaming in pure, stark terror, when boom! 
An earthshaking implosion of catastrophic proportions erupts,
Causing all to collapse inward into a finite point of brilliant, horrific energy
You may call him "Bang! Pow! Boom!"

Bang, pow, boomI said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test--I'm rappin to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet

To the black, to the white, the red, and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie

I got a lincoln continental and a sunroof cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool
Which really is on the wall
I got a color tv so I can see
The knicks play basketball
Hear me talkin bout checkbooks, credit cards
More money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker
Not a dime til I made it again

I said I can't wait til the end of the week
When I'm rappin to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on hank sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong

Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three mcs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker mcs try to prove a point

We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mike til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was comin home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mike and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said damn fly guy I'm in love with you
The casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said I go by the name of lois lane
And you could be my boyfiend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppoose
Flyin through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it , do it
An I'm here an I'm there I'm big bang hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it don't stop why'all a tick a tock why'all you don't stop
Go hotel motel what you gonna do today(say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank drive off in a def oj
Everybody go hotel motel holiday inn
You say if your girl starts actin up then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my oj
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to master gee so he could shock the house 
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin to the beat and feelin all right
Everybody was dancin on the floor
Doin all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin we're a helluva crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party ya got to have the movies
So we'll get right down and give you the groove
For you to dance you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair
But let me tell ya somethin there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're makin it home
And tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleepin ya start to dream
And thinkin how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doin a do
Rockin ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of wonder mike
Come on wonder mike do what ya like

Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
Like dracula with out his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin up and not comin down
Is just like the beat without the sound no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh uh that's bull
So your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says man there's plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin here makin myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby bubbah but we're still friends
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rockin
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say hank can ya rock
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo
I said come on 
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said sit down punk I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a mc steal your rhyme
So from sixty six til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker mcs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that's called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a god d--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker mc's can bite all night
A tick a tock why'all a beat beat why'all
A lets rock why'all ya don't stop

I said the age of one my life begun
At the age of two I was doin the do
At the age of three it was you and me
Rockin to the sounds of the master gee
At the age of four I was on the floor
Givin all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the master gee its all the way live
At the age of six I was a pickin up sticks
Rappin to the beat my stick was fixed
At the age of seven I was rockin in heaven dontcha know I went off

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moonWhat can you see from your window?
I can't see anything from mine.
Flags on the side of the highway
And scripture on grocery store signs.
Maybe eighteen was too early.
Maybe thirty or forty is too.
Did you get your chance to make peace with the man
Before he sent down his angels for you?

Mamas and grandmamas love you
'cause that's all they know how to do.
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues.

Your wife said this all would be funny
When you came back home in a week.
You'd turn twenty-two and we'd celebrate you
In a bar or a tent by the creek.
Your baby would just about be here.
Your very last tour would be up
But you won't be back. They're all dressing in black
Drinking sweet tea in styrofoam cups.

Mamas and grandmamas love you.
American boys hate to lose.
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues.

Now the high school gymnasium's ready,
Full of flowers and old legionnaires.
Nobody showed up to protest,
Just sniffle and stare.
But there's red, white, and blue in the rafters
And there's silent old men from the corps.
What did they say when they shipped you away
To fight somebody's Hollywood war?

Nobody here could forget you.
You showed us what we had to lose.
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues.

No, no you never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues.You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in

You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
To a dark place
Walking in light
Glowing, walking in light
Gold ring around you, the
Hues of you, the
Golden sunlight of you

There was a little drawing of a heart next to that, followed by an exclamation mark
The back of his was covered in stuff, stuff like
Brandon is not a very nice guy, but Alex is so nice
And that had the exclamation thing too
It was just silly crap that hit the spot
And he let himself be drawn inSome days go on forever, 
Last long into the night, 
Some days feel like December, although its warm on the inside.

If you're searching for truth you must look in the mirror and makes of what you can see
Just be, just be

They say learning to love yourself is the first step that you take when you want to be real.
Flying on planes, to exotic locations won't teach you how you really feel.
Face up to the fact, that you are who you are and nothing could change that belief.

Just be, Just be

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!She's gonna come in and say how are you
My day was pretty blue
Sit on the sofa she'll take off her shoes

I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
Making friends with a homeless torn up man

OhI wonder if he knows 
The pleasure that he shows
I can't seem to hide from the sounds around me
I wonder where she goes
Dressed up in those clothes
We just watch her drive away

A woman sees her friends 
Continuous distraction
She fills up the days
While she waits for phone calls
A life in evidence 
Is evidently lonely
We all need a tale to tell

Just another list of consequences
Of things that we do 
Just another hit of happenings
That we have to live through 
In and out of all the reasons
And all the whys and wherefores 
We just want to keep on breathing 

My view is compromised 
With undernourished eyes
They watch and they wait
For an altercation
These boxes on the road
These overpriced abodes
Will somebody give them life

We occupy a space
With barriers and fences
There's no line of sight
Into this protection
Forgive us all a cheat
Is just another symptom
We all need a tale to tell

Just another list of consequences of things that we do 
Just another hit of happenings that we have to live through 
In and out of all the reasons and all the whys and wherefores 
We just want to keep on breathing 
We just want to keep on breathing 

We will watch and learn. 
We will watch you perform, 
Waiting behind the seat, 
Telling the tale. 

I wonder if he knows 
How far his pleasure goes, 
It all comes apart at the stroke of midnight. 
I wonder where she goes 
Now she's in some clothes. 
We just hear her drive away. 

Just another list of consequences

Hoy sera la ultima vez
Que vuelva a creer en tus mentiras
Hoy me alejare de tu lado
Vivirás en el pasado
Mejor te olvido

Yo te creía todo lo que me hablabas
Que era el hombre de tu vida y que me amas
Hoy en día todo es diferente
No se lo que tienes en mente
Últimamente estas cambiando demasiado
Con tus amigas y todas me caen mal
Por eso te recibe la cartera
Un nombre de un hombre en tus letras
Y empece a temblar Nunca pensé que lo iba a esperar
Y empece a sudar pensando en lo que iba hacer y todo lo que yo te ame

Siempre e sido fiel contigo
Dime cuando no te demostré cariño
Solo quería tenerte ami lado
Sin saber q estabas jugando
Sabia que ibas a decir que don amigos
Pero ya no te creo como antes
Hay viene la salidera
Aquí viene el amargue

Y empece a dudar porque tu me llegas tarde a casa con una cara
Y empece a recordar de todo lo que hizo por ti y tu me lo desvuelves así

Y llorare, y moriré, y sufriré
Sin tu amor
Y llorare, y moriré, no quiero seguir sin tu amor

Me rompiste el corazon
Tanto que me hablaste del futuro cual futuro??
Abusaste de mi amor: cambie mi forma de ser tu no valías la pena mujer
Te vas arrepentir cuando recuerdes las cosas
Que te ofrecí dime quien te lo va a dar
Nadie
Y ahora solo me puedes escuchar en la pista de una baile
Voy hacer el arte mas brillante que nunca
Y tu te quedas como antes con dudas fue tu decisión
Te deseo suerte y éxitoLove was a promise made of smoke
In a frozen copse of trees
A bone cold and older than our bodies
Slowly floating in the sea

Every morning there were planes
The shiny blades of pagan angels in our father's skies
Every evening I would watch her hold the pillow
Tight against her hollows, her unholy child

I was still a beggar shaking out my stolen coat
Among the angry cemetery leaves
When they caught the king beneath the borrowed car
Righteous, drunk, and fumbling for the royal keys

Love was a father's flag and sung like a shank
In a cake on our leather boots
A beautiful feather floating down
To where the birds had shit on empty chapel pews

Every morning we found one more machine
To mock our ever waning patience at the well
Every evening she'd descend the mountain stealing socks
And singing something good where all the horses fell

Like a snake within the wilted garden wall
I'd hint to her every possibility
While with his gun the pagan angel rose to say,
"My love is one made to break every bended knee"All the earth come alive
Lift your eyes to the morning
Let our hearts beat again
With a lifeblood that never fails
Your love it will never fail

Breaking down the divide in a holy collision
The Divine in disguise
Took the cross for our sin and shame
Our God You will never fail

See the lost in return
Swing the doors ever wider
See the tide as it turns
Love and mercy is on the rise
As the world folds into Your light
All creation will see Your light

Hear the sound of freedom rise
As our song breaks the silence
Echoing the angel cry
Let us lift up Your holy Name
Hereafter to sing Your praise
Forever and ever

We will hold, we will love
We will fall in surrender
We will rise, we will run
We will live to declare Your Name
Forever to bring You praise
Forever we'll lift up Your Name

The universe on its knees
See the stars in surrender
God above kings and queens
Every idol will bend and break
But our God You will never fail
Forever and ever

We will hold, we will love
We will fall in surrender
We will rise, we will run
We will live to declare Your Name
Forever to bring You praise
Jesus, Jesus
We will hold, we will love
We will fall in surrender
We will rise, we will run
We will live to declare Your Name
Forever to bring You praise
Forever we'll lift up Your Name

Swing the doors wider
Sound the praise louder
All our hearts cry out
For the glory of Your Name
Our God You will never fail
Lift the Name higher
Shine the light brighter
All the earth cry out
For the glory of Your Name
Our God You will never fail
Forever we'll lift up Your NameYo soy jardinero, hago milagro de amor

And I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again

What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And the crying time for me had just begun

Today I started loving you again
I'm right back to where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you againThis world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart

I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

Mmm, well nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now

Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar (spin 'round in the bar)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind
Is blowin', is blowin'
Remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

Mmm, nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now
Nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now

Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark)
And this broken record

Mhmm, but nothing breaks like a heart
But nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, but nothing breaks like a heartIt seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or whenOut of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mineDeaf chords, dead ends

Street wars, straight men
Cowboys, Indians
Red souls, red friends

You forgot all the things that we did, all the things that we went through
Baby I still love ya
I love the way you talk down
I love your condescending tone
It makes it easy baby....it makes it damn easy
Never again
Awww never again
Never again
I took your promise with a grain of salt
When you brake em' its nobody's fault
How many times did you come through
Same old story me feeling blue
I picked you up when you fell down
But you got up and you left town
That's just your nature baby 
Its just your nature baby
Never again
Ya never again
The trouble with you is you gotta hole in the back of your head
You forgot all the things that we did, all the things that we went through
Baby I still love ya

It makes it damn easy
Never again

Never again
Baby.....you and i..........never againMy body's aching from laying in this bed
I went singing in the rain and the cold got to my head
I don't know who's paying, I just know what the doctor said
84 years of a sinning life and in the morning I'll be dead, oh yeah

I had three daughters, a new man for every one
And the only man that I ever loved left me with my only son
I was a no good mother, I was a no good wife
There's only one thing that I did right in this godforsaken life

So Saint Peter, won't you open up the big white gate
?Cause I heard about forgiveness and I hope it ain't too late
No, I ain't no holy roller but you go tell your King
That all the folks up in heaven might like to hear me sing

I sang to my children before they strayed so far
I sang for my lover or a nickel in a tip jar
I never knew Jesus, I never read the Good Book
But on my day of dying I'm giving life a second look

Saint Peter, won't you open up the big white gate
?Cause I heard about forgiveness and I hope it ain't too late
No, I ain't no holy roller but you go tell your King
That all the folks up in heaven might like to hear me sing, yes, they would

It's coming on time now and my body's getting cold
I've got no will, I've got no prayer, my story's all been told
I'm ready for the land of fire but I'd love to see the land of gold
So nurse bring me my guitar, one more song before I go

Saint Peter, won't you open up the big white gate
?Cause I heard about forgiveness and I'm hoping that it ain't too late
No, I ain't no holy roller but you go tell your King
That all the folks up in heaven might like to hear me sing
All the folks up in heaven might like to hear me

Fly it all out like an eagle in a sunbeam
Ride it on out like you were a bird

Wear a tall hat like a druid in the old days
Wear a tall hat and a tatooed gown
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
Wear your hair long, babe you can't go wrong

Catch a bright star and a place it on your forehead
Say a few spells and baby, there you go
Take a black cat and sit it on your shoulder
And in the morning you'll know all you know, oh

Wear a tall hat like a druid in the old days
Wear a tall hat and a tatooed gown
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
Wear your hair long, babe you can't go wrong

(A free man)    I'm so glad I served my time, I'm gonna meet the girl that I left behind.  And when I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got.  Ooo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got.    There were times, there were times when each day seems like a year.  But the sweet things she said in her letters, made the times disappear, oh yeah.  She said, No one's arms will I let hold me 'cause in your arms is where I want   to be.    So when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got.  Ooo, when I see her... (I'm gonna give her all) all the love I've got.    Ooo, baby, baby, baby, I miss you so. Ugh!  Hmmm (Aw)    Countless nights I stared out my window at the moonlight, yes I did now.  Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight, oh yeah.  I must've been out of my mind to do the wrong I did and leave her behind.    So when I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got.  Woo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got.  Believe me when I tell ya  When I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got.Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Here we go here we go

I'm sick (sick)
I'm dead (dead)
I'm torn (torn)
I'm f*cking alive (alive)The silent night has turned to a night of fear
With windows howling wind into your ear
You listen to the spirits far behind
These things you hear are too much for your mind

The bell strikes and your spine chills like the grave
The chill that turns your blood from red to grey
You know that with these things you see and hear
The silent night has turned to a night of fear

Image on your bedroom wall
Shadows marching in the hall
Just about to flip your mind
Just about to trip your mind
Just about to flip your mind
Just about to trip your mind

The green and purple lights affect your sight
Your mother cannot comfort you tonight
Your brain calls out for help that's never there
The silent night has turned to a night of fearGeorgia, Georgia, the whole day through
There's that old sweet song that keeps you, Georgia, on my mind

Oh Georgia, Georgia, the song of you
Comes as sweet and clear just like moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out for me
And other eyes have smiles tenderly
But still in peaceful dreams I see
That the road, the road leads back to you

Oh hey Georgia, ooh Georgia, no peace, no peace I find
And there's still this old sweet song that keeps you, Georgia, on my mind
There's that old sweet song that keeps you, Georgia, on my mind
That keeps you, Georgia, on my mindParis big city
Draw lines disgust me sometimes
Are you ready?
Living two lives not infinity
Big insanity
Called jeopardy
City kills
And rumors spread
Dress good
Stressful dreads
In nasty trades
Spread sins

Martin Luther bb kills
Basic full flavors
Dictates rules and behaviors
Knows TV shows
In order to be sure he rules
Take it or walk out
Can't deal with him coz he shouts:
Desperate, lost, prison?
Want the last season?

Bad campaign
But clients remain
Advertising's my
Business but I
Rely on lie
Tasteless: key factor success

Wonder why I like the guy
Looks at me
And says with a smile:
I feel so sorry, all your friends gone with the wealthy
"shorty"

Bo! Let me hope
Let me open the door
To my goal
Let me glow
Is this really mister gold

A history
With no mystery mistress understand me
I'm a player without remedy
A stranger coz nobody knows me
No I don't need your help, step back and bounce again
Sincerely yours and best regards
Gold diggaz best regards gold diggaz

Ain't got good manners I thought
One day you could have stop
But u went on writing song
Go ahead in life yo yo
Catch fame
And mum says no
Father blame
And mum says no
Writing song but mum says no
Life is not mellow

Bo! Let me hope
Let me open the door
To my goal
Let me glow
Is this really mister gold

I won't be back next morning
Last chance and a first warning
What we need is what we're wanting
To get friends I'll be poking
And like a lion, we'll be roaming
7th & 8th grade remembering, 
Those used to be the days for kidding

Bo! Let me hope
Let me open the door
To my goal
Let me glow
Is this really mister goldRaindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me, it won't be long
'Til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free, 'cause nothing's worrying meYou can hardly wait to tell all your friends
How his kisses taste sweet like wine 
And how he always makes your heart skip a beat
Every time he walks by
And if you feeling down 
He'll pick you up
He'll hold you close 
when you're makin' love
He's every thing you've been dreaming of
Oh Baby...

I wish you'd look at me that way
Your beautiful eyes lookin' deep into mine
Telling me more than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive
Baby to you all I am 
Is the invisible man

You probably spend hours on the phone
Talkin' 'bout nothing at all
It doesn't matter what the conversation 
Just as long as he called
Lost in a love so real
And so sincere
You wipe away each other's tears
Your face lights up
Whenever he appears

I wish you'd look at me that way
Your beautiful eyes lookin' deep into mine
Telling me more than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive
Baby to you all I am 
Is the invisible manThe time has come once and for all
You've met your match, you will fall
This little game we play is gonna break us down
Only one of us can wear the crown
It's not as easy as you thought it'd be
When it's down to you versus me

I play rough,I don't need to try, you like to play mean but the score never lies

[Chorus]
Game over, game over, game over, for now
Winning the game's the only rule allowed
No more "good luck", or cheers from the crowd
When the game began you never thought you'd lose, but your time is up I play to bruise
Look around and find you've lost your team, you did your best but you ran out of steam

You're all out of wishes, kiss your dreams goodbye, the ends the same
It's not whether you win or lose
It's "how you play the game"

[Chorus]

Is that all you've got, see'mon, uh uh, bring it on

[Chorus]

Game, overOnce I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.Vai meu irmão
Pega esse avião
Você tem razão
De correr assim desse frio
Mas beija meu Rio De Janeiro
Antes que um aventureiro
Lance mão

Pede perdão
Pela omissão um tanto forçada
Mas não diga nada
Que me viu chorando
E pros da pesada diz que eu vou levando
E vê como é que anda aquela vida à toa
E se puder me manda uma notícia boa

Ogni volta è un massacro se tu te ne vai
Sì lo so che mi piace fermarmi a pensarti
Ma se posso toccarti funziona di più

E non serve spiegarti la storia che sei (le parole son senza ritorno lo sai)
Preferisco appoggiare le labbra alle tue (col respiro che si agita contro le mie)
Non mi va di parlare di ieri
Con la vita non ci sto mai pari
Tu sei molto diversa dagli altri, dai di più

A pensarci bene il bello di te
È che viaggi sempre sulle mie frequenze, sei grande
Ed in certe cose sei come me
Non t'accontenti di essere una fra tante, sei grande, ooh

Ed ho molto rispetto per ogni tua idea (non la voglio cambiare per pazzesca che sia)
Non ti stresso per farti più simile a me (che se fossi diversa non saresti più te)
Poi nessuno conosce nessuno
Non si sa mai con chi stai, però

A pensarci bene il bello di te
È che viaggi sempre sulle mie frequenze, sei grande
Prendi quel che serve fino che c'è
Mi dai tanto e non te ne accorgi neanche
Sei grande, ma grande

Sei grande

È che viaggi sempre sulle mie frequenze, sei grandeYou went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to meFingertips are all I have
Have you heard the sea?
The water's edge is all I have
Have you heard it breathe?
An endless sigh I cannot hear
Here I cease to run
Arid mouth so hard to speak
Speak? Cat got my tongue
Describe to me how I look
Look what I've become
Describe to me how I look

I'm not scared of dying
I'm not scared of death
I'll keep a smile 'til my last breath
I've loved 'til I've lost
I've lived how I felt
One day I will find peace within myself

Boyish grin, it bears me well
Where can I begin?
Don't forget I'm still around
How the wind feels free
Behind the smile I fade away
The wayward days are gone
I love this power
I love this power
I love this power that's crushed so easily
I love this power

I'm not scared of dying
I'm not scared of death
I'll keep a smile 'til my last breath
I've loved 'til I've lost
I've lived how I felt
One day I will find peace within myself

I want to take all the sadness
Of the world from your shoulders
I want to take all the sadness
Of the world from your shoulders
I want to take all the sadnessAnd you know it's time to go
Through the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning
Light in the distance

And you hunger for the time
Time to heal, desire, time
And your earth moves beneath
Your own dream landscape

Oh, oh, oh
On borderland we run

I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight
A high road
A high road out from here

The city walls are all come down
The dust, a smoke screen all around
See faces ploughed like fields that once
Gave no resistance

And we live by the side of the road
On the side of a hill
As the valley explode
Dislocated, suffocated
The land grows weary of its own

Oh come away, oh come away, oh come away, I say I
Oh come away, come away, oh come, oh come away, I say I

Oh, oh, oh 
On borderland we run
And still we run
We run and don't look back
I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight
Tonight

I'll be there tonight, I believe
I'll be there so high
I'll be there tonight, tonight

Oh come away, I say, I say oh
Oh come away, I say

The wind will crack in winter time
This bomb-blast lightning waltz
No spoken words, just a scream

Oh
Oh

Tonight we'll build a bridge
Across the sea and land
See the sky, the burning rain
She will die and live again
Tonight

And your heart beats so slow
Through the rain and fallen snow
Across the fields of mourning
Lights in the distance

Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep
For tonight, at last
I am coming home
I am coming homeThe time, has turned its back on me
The time, has no sympathy
Now the time, has taken my love

Today, while we were side by side 
The time seemed just to fly by
Now the time, is my enemy

For our day would be bright and gay
And our love would just float away
I'll be floating on a holy clover
For our day, would be almost over

The time, has turned its back on me
The time, has no sympathy
Now the time, has taken my loveOoh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.I'd move to Rockferry,
Tomorrow
And I'd build my house, baby
With sorrow

I'd leave my shadow,
To fall behind
And I wouldn't write to you
Cause I'm not that kind

The midnight trains are boarding
All wrap up 8s
I pick my load and I fill my truck
Before it?s too late

I leave the stars to judge
My every move
I'm not going to think of you, oh
I'd get the blues

There's no sleep on the journey
Away from time
A bag of songs and a heavy heart
Won't make me down

I'll give it all my strength and my mind
I'll make this decision with or without

I'd move to Rockferry,
Tomorrow
And I'd build my house, baby
With sorrow

I'd leave my shadow,
To fall behind
And I wouldn't write to you
Cause I'm not that kind
Not that kind

Rockferry, not that kind

Rockferry...It's as bad as I remember 
If I remember it at all 
I want to take you higher 
But I'm afraid we would fall 
I'm choking on the smoke of my last cigarette 
If there's peace beyond this pasture 
I haven't seen it yet 

I'm going down, down, down 
Choke my screams 
I used to dream 
But dreams are empty 
Clean me... 

I can't pick the meat decaying in my teeth 
I have to numb my gums first 
Pretend you're asleep 
I'm leary of your pity 
I'm sorry for my daughter 
I can't see the bottom 
Wash me dirty water 


I got a woman, 
Mean as she can be
I got a woman,
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think

A black cat up and died of fright
'Cause she crossed his path last night
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me

She kiss so hard, she bruise my lips
Hurts so good, my heart just flips
Oh, I got a woman

Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me

The strangest gal I ever had
Never happy 'less she's mad
Oh, I got a woman

Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me

She makes love without a smile
Ooh, hot dog that drives me wild

Beep beepThe party's over, it's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
It's time to wind up the masquerade
Just make your mind up
The piper must be paid

The party's over, the candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night
It seemed to be right just being with him
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

The party's over, it's time to call it a day

And taken the moon away
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

It's all over, my friendBuild your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me

Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me

For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all and I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go

So make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, come on to me

Oh, make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me
Por ti, esta noche
El cielo se abrirá
Llorando mil estrellas
Sangrando oscuridad
Por ti mis sentimientos
Se arrullan sin dudar
Escurriendo mi tristeza
Ahuyentando soledad

Es por ti
Que caigo en mi obsesión
Buscando una razón
De olvidar tus besos
Perdida, en este amor
Es por ti
Que vuelvo en tu mirar
Perdida en alta mar
Y es por ti, mi vida
Que no puedo escapar de ti

Por ti, bebí el veneno
Del néctar de tu piel
Por ti derramé mi copa
Del pudor del placer
Por ti, hoy sopla el viento
Borrando mi pesar
Tragándose mis penas
Muriendo en tu mirar

Y es por tiA country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an "Oh, beg your pardon"
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said "May I have the next one?"
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words "Ever after"
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dreamVamos comer

Vamos comer, vamos comerAnd now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.When I was a seeker
I sought both night and day
I asked the Lord to help me
And he showed me the way

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Our Jesus Christ is born

He made me a watchman
Upon a city wall
And if I am a Christian
I am the least of all
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Our Jesus Christ is bornWhere you been? Ain't you for weeks
You been hanging out with all those jesus freaks
Oh yeah and I feel like giving in
And where were you, when I wanted to work? You were still
In bed
You're a total jerk

There's a place for abstract and there's a place for
Noise and there's a place for every kind of sound so come

On now and tell me why there's a void
It's all my fault, yes I'm to blame
Ain't got no money, ain't got no fame
And that's why, I feel like giving in
And all those songs, like crystal ball, dismantled king
You know I love them all
But oh, I still feel like giving in.I hob amal a Madel g'habt,

At last, I'm aware of love'

I asked my papa not long ago
Now 'What is love' and he said,
'Hello, you have to find out for yourself,
You cannot learn from somebody else'
And someday you'll be aware of love,
I'd say someday if you live long enough
You'll be aware of love'

Auh, but I was anxious and couldn't wait
And every little girl I took on a date
Told her that I really, really loved her
Vowed I'd never ever love another
But found it was just puppy love
I said I found yes, I did' yes, I did
It was just puppy love'

Auh, but like papa told me one day I met you
I knew right then girl I had to get you
Took you in my arms and really kissed you
When you went away child
You know I missed you

And I, I'm aware of love
At last I have found true love'No time to be wasted
Hangin' 'round with you


I've got better things to shoot for

And little time to do

Can't you see I've got it


With no help from you
I've turned around, knocked you down

and burned the bridge from you


I want control


I've got to get control

with no regrets, naturally



I want complete control


Oh changes will be made
To keep control for good
I'll change the whole world

And everything around you

I don't need no help


And nothing from you


I'll get everything I want
You know it will be true


Complete control

Complete control

Complete control




You do what you wanna do
I'll leave it all up to you
In time, I'll find love again

Hot love growin' cold
Just when you thought you'd found a heart of gold
Looks like, I've been fooled again

Oh but it's all right with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck I'm bound to win
And I'll fall in love, I'll fall in love again

And you're always sittin' ring side
Just a rollin' with the changing tide
The tide has washed you from my mind

And I guess you think you've got it made
Oh but then you never were afraid
Of anything that you've left behind

Oh but it's all right with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck yes I'm bound to win
'Cause I'll fall in love, yes I'll fall in love again

Yea, yea, yea, oh yea
Yea, yea, yea, oh yea
I'll fall in love again
I'll fall in love again baby
I said "I, I'll fall in love again"
Yes I'll fall in love again

Here's something to compare it to
Like the little things you used to do
Like giving more than you take

Funny how the reasons grow
Then the very next thing you know
The odds change, dividing up the cake

Hey but it's all right with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck yes I'm bound to win
'Cause I'll fall in love

Yes it's all right with me now
Don't worry 'bout me baby I'll get along somehow
Yes it's all right
Yes it's all right
Yea will you do what you wanna do?
Oh yes it's all right with me now

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.

Anybody can find someone

To rev ?em up and turn ?em on

And baby it?s a lot of fun but then what

When a little time has past

You take off your Mardi Gras mask

That?s when you know if you really have the right stuff


Truly true love

It?s full on fightin? then kissin? all night even though I know I?m right and you?re wrong

Truly true love

Baby it?s the glue keeping me and you holding onto what we know that we couldn?t do on our own

Making love when we first wake up

That?s the icing on the cake but

Seeing me without my make- up

That?s truly truly


We?ve been down and up and down

Thought of throwing in the towel

And we?re far from perfect now but so what

?Cause it?s about the ride we take

And the memories we make

And the way the earth still quakes when we touch



Truly true love

It?s full on fightin? then kissin? all night even though I know I?m right and you?re wrong

Truly true love

Baby it?s the glue keeping me and you holding onto what we know that we couldn?t do on our own

Making love when we first wake up

That?s the icing on the cake but

Seeing me without my make- up

That?s truly true love

YeahIf you're alone and you need a friend 
Someone to make you forget your problems 
Just come along baby 
Take my hand 
I'll be your lover tonight

This is what I want to do 
Let's have some fun 
What I want is me and you

Boom boom boom boom

Let's spend the night together

From now until forever 
Boom boom boom boom

Let's spend the night together 
Together in my room 

Everybody get on down 
The Vengaboys are back in town

Boom boom boom boom 
I want you in my room 
Let's spend the night together 
From now until forever 
Boom boom boom boom 
I want to double boom 
Let's spend the night together 
Together in my roomWaves in low tide,
Sons of the night
And my memories echo back again.
Stranger that I am
In my own land
where no one will remember my name.

When you hear me calling will you be there
When you see me falling will you be there

Time was the force,
Brought me back on course
In the darkness distant fires on a strand
Time is my disguise,
Against hostile seeking eyes
and the waves wipe out my footprints in the sand.

When you hear me calling will you be there
When you see me falling will you be there

Now my time has come
Return into the sun
Cause I've always been searching for you
If I win if I lose
No charge no excuse
All my wondering make sure my aims are true

When you hear me calling will you be there
When you see me falling will you be thereYou knew I wouldn't go
that's why you threatened me... would I stay?
you crawled up on your knees
a victioms pretty please...
would I stay? would I stay?... and I stayed
how many more times, till I breakout
from that guilty mess
you taught me to hate to love you
that's because you love to hate yourself
I wish it had a happy end
like the fairy tales
pretend there can be
but things are not the same
when your life love was a game
of make believe
you get everything you want
but not everything you need
and it's true... you recieve...
what you achieve
how many screaming fights, tears of rage
until it ended
how many times, till I say who I am
and don't pretendBaby
Mmm baby
'M gonna bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Gone up, go higher, all aboard
'M take my seat, a-right way back, ooooh yeah
Watch this train goin' down the track
Gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out, man move

Try to tell you baby
What you tryin' to do
Tryin' to love me baby
Love some other man too
Bring it on home, bring it on home

Went 'n a little walk downtown, ah yeah
Missed 'n got back late
Found a note there waiting
An' it said, Daddy, I just can't wait
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it back home, bring it back home to me baby

Tell you, pretty baby
You love to mess me 'roun'
I'm gonna give you lovin', baby
Gonna move you outta town

Sweetest little baby

Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, alright

Bring it on home

Well, I would only be in your way
And so I'll go, but yet I know
That I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories

That's all I have, and all I'm taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
Cause we both know that I'm not
What you need

I will always love you
I will always love you

And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh, I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I love you, I will always love

I, I will always, always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love youIt seems you're fixed forever
In a world so close to here
Though I see you running from me
The more you run, the more you're near

'Cause I was there in the beginning
And I will be there in the end
With a heart that's beating for you
And a love that wants to mend

Can you feel my love arising
Falling down from up above?
Can you see my heart?s horizon?
Can you feel my hunger love?

When the world has left you lonely
And you've finally had enough
You'll know my feet are running
Running for my hunger love

Let me show you perfect passion
Let me take you far away
From a life without direction
Where you've played it safe

Welcome to the days of danger
Risk and security
Where love will change your nature
If you will just believe

Can you feel my love?
Can you taste my love?
Feel my love
Taste my loveI called you from the hotel phone
I haven't dialed this code before
I'm sleeping later and waking later
I'm eating less and thinking more
And how am I without you?
Am I more myself or less myself?
I feel younger, louder
Like I don't always connect
Like I don't ever connect

And do you like being single?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
And do I like being single?
Am I coming back?
Am I coming back?

I'll put my suitcase here for now
I'll turn the TV to the bed
But if no one calls and I don't speak all day
Do I disappear?
And look at me without you
I'm quite proud of myself
I feel reckless, clumsy
Like I'm making a mistake
A really big mistake 

And do you like being single?
Do you want me back?

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!Everybody's got something
They had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday
That just seems to grow with time
There's no use looking back, or wondering
How it could be now or might've been
All this I know
But still I can't find ways to let you go

I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you

Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time
And tomorrow can never be
'Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind
There's no use looking back,oh wondering
How it should been, now oh might've been
All this I know
But,still I can't find ways to let you go

I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you

You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes you will
Say you will
You know you will oh baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget
There's no use looking back,oh wondering
Because love is a strange and funny thing
No matter how hard I try and try
I just can't say good bye
No no no no

I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with youSo many times in my life
I've been alone, left alone
Heart broken and
Turned around
I find myself
Crying in the night time
Dying out loud
In the night I sleeplessly
Wake up
From a dream that's
Tormenting me
I, I, I, I, I gotta get help
Oh, yeah

Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Come heal me
Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Set me free

Late at night I was afraid
And I tried to turn away
I was afraid to face
What in-evil-it-able is

Say you know the way
To find true freedom
Can you save yourself
From the pain you're feeling
Something in my head
That you're dreaming
That the angels said

Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Come heal me
Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Set me free
Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Come heal me
Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Set me free

I am on a mission, a mission of love
I am on a mission, a mission of love
I am on a mission, a mission of love
I am on a mission, a mission of love
I am on a mission, a mission of love

Love...is the healer

Love is the healer
Come as a healer
Set me free
Love is the healer
Come as a healer
Set me free
Love is the healer
Come as a healer
Set me free
Love is the healer
Come as a healer
Set me free

Do you know the way to love
Do you know the place of love
Do you know what love
Can do
Do you know what
It'll do for you
There's a pale moon in the sky 
The kind you make your wishes on 
Oh, like the light in your eyes 
The one I built my dreams upon 
It's not there any longer 
Something happened somewhere and we both know why 
But me, I'm getting stronger 
We must stop pretending 
I can't live this life 

I don't care who's wrong or right 
I don't really want to fight no more (too much talking babe) 
Let's sleep on it tonight 
I don't really want to fight no more 
This is time for letting go

I hear a whisper in the air 
It simply doesn't bother me 
Oh, can't you see that I don't care 
Or are you you looking right through me 
It seems to me that lately 
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry 
Could it be that maybe 
This crazy situation is the reason why 

I don't care who's wrong or right 
I don't really want to fight no more (too much talking babe) 
Let's sleep on it tonight 
I don't really want to fight no more (tired of all these games) 
But baby, don't you know 
That I don't want to hurt no more (it's time, I'm walking, babe) 
Don't care now who's to blame 
I don't really want to fight no more 
This is time for letting go

Hanging on to the past 
It only stands in our way 
We had to grow for our love to last 
But we just grew apart 
No, I don't want to hurt no more 

But baby, don't you know 
No, I don't want to hurt no more (too much talking, babe) 
So let's sleep on it tonight 
I don't really want to fight no more 
This is time for letting go
No, I don't want to hurt no more (too much, hey baby) 
Don't care now who's to blame 
I don't really want to fight no more 
'Cause it's time for letting goHe said
"I was in my early forties
With a lot of life before me
And a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options
And talkin' 'bout sweet time"
I asked him
"When it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit you
When you get that kind of news?
Man, what'd you do?"

He said
"I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying"

He said
"I was finally the husband
That most of the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden going fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
I finally read the Good Book, and I
Took a good, long, hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then

I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
Like tomorrow was a gift
And you've got eternity
To think about
What you'd do with it
What could you do with it
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?

Skydiving
I went Rocky mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying"I've been waitin'
For a day like this to come
Struck like lightnin'
My heart's beating like a drum
On the edge of something wonderful

Face to face with changes
What's it all about?
Life is crazy
But I know I can work it out
Cause' I got you to live it with me

I feel all right, I'm gonna take on the world
Light up the stars, I've got some pages to turn
I'm singing oh oh oh

Yeah it's a mad hurricane
Alright hold on tight
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway starWash away all the lines on your face that show how you've aged it's a long way down
Your back's been broken you can't make the rounds the tables are turned as the litany goes...
You're a rotten old man who'll be covered in dirt on your knees
And pray to the maker that caused you to bleed

Turn back the hand on the clock
You're a bitter old man who's done nothing
But work your hands to the bone on the assembly lines
You've grown cold to the touch of the ones that you love
Ignorance is something you can't over come but you've passed it on down
And that's something much worse for a bitter young man...
Is now taking the torch

Silent scorn - you've taken it out on the ones you adore Inside rage
They've left you before but they'll come back again
They'll pray for you with all their love
But this time your indifference just can't be excused Forced amends
Well it's something you'll die with but it goes on for them...
For a bitter young man...has now taken the torch...It started out today
I feel alive and the air has changed
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
It's taken an age just to
Find a way but I made it through
I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone

These are the days, this is the place where I belong
Lost in another world, I believe our time will come
We shift and we change, I took a long time coming round
But I'm standing here, still standing here
I await for a breath, I'm coming up for air

One look away
The lost chance and the plans I've made
They come and go, they come and go
Took off on the silver years
The fault lines and the cracks appear
They come and go, they come and go

These are the days, this is the place where I belong
Lost in another world, I believe our time will come
We shift and we change, I took a long time coming round
But I'm standing here, still standing here
I await for a breath, I'm coming up for air[Chorus]
Where will I be 365 days from now
Tell me
How will I feel 365 nights without you
Oh what would I do?

I remember what you used to say
Things won't tumble down
Now we're here and finally it changed
When I'm standing on solid ground
I don't understand
When did we go wrong?
And I can't imagine

[Chorus]

And now it feels like we're drifting apart
Things are not what they used to be
Now I know it's written in your heart
You don't wanna be a part of me
I don't understand
What did I do wrong?
And I can't imagine

[Chorus]

Oh what would I do
Tell me

I've been trying so hard
Not to let it show
But deep within my feelings
They glow
Before you leave me and let me go
Something I need to know
Repeat Chorus
365 nights without youWiem, ze czekasz, ze stoisz
Boisz sie, ze nie przyjde, ze to byl tylko zart
Nie! Nie zartuje, bardzo tesknie i czuje
Ze bez Ciebie umieram, powietrza mi brak
Nie! Nie zartuje, bardzo tesknie i czuje
Ze bez Ciebie umieram, powietrza mi brak


Nieuchwytny, ulotny jak cien
Przez blask i oczu mgnienie
Ide! Nie ide! Ide. Biegn?!
Kochany biegne do Ciebie!
Ide! Nie ide! Ide. Biegne!
Kochany biegne do Ciebie!

Biegne a serce mi drzy
Drzy jak schwytany ptak

This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hearSheepdog, standing in the rain
Bullfrog, doing it again
Some kind of happiness is
Measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
Something special when you smile

Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is
Measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
To listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Big man (yeah) walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is
Measured out in you
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

They were summoned from the hillside
They were called in from the glen,
And the country found them ready
At the stirring call for men.
Let no tears add to their hardships
As the soldiers pass along,
And although your heart is breaking
Make it sing this cheery song

Keep the Home Fires Burning, 
While your hearts are yearning,
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out
'Til the boys come home.

Overseas there came a pleading, 
"Help a nation in distress."
And we gave our glorious laddies
Honour bade us do no less,
For no gallant son of freedom
To a tyrant's yoke should bend,
And a noble heart must answer
To the sacred call of "Friend."

Keep the Home Fires Burning, 
While your hearts are yearning,
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out
'Til the boys come home.Forward,forward, back, back, back
I've fallen and I can't get up and I'm slipping through the cracks
I'm in a crisis and I can't afford the prices
No means to feed my family, never mind the nices
No escape, no pleasure
I really can't seem to get my shit together
Can't protect my children from the weather
Me and my baby skin grows the toughest leather

Where do they go?
When it rains
Where do they go?
When it snows
Where do they go?
When the cold winds blow
Where do they go?
When we are warm behind closed doors

The children cry themselves to sleep
Another night with no food to eat
Tear soaked pillow is a step of concrete
It's enough to drive me to rob steal kill or cheat
You may ask how can you live this rigid life
No means to feed or house your babies and your wife
As I will, I sunk to depths you can't fathom
My lifes a blunder, it's no wonder why you can't imagine

Where do they go?
When it rains
Where do they go?
When it snows
Where do they go?
When the cold winds blow
Where do they go?
When we are warm behind closed doors

Dem a go back down, dem a go way out
Back to this real world we live in
Dem a too far down, dem a too far out
For the real concern we're givin'
Dem all rob and steal, shoot up and kill
Is the common misconception
We all justify, we all ease our minds
With these deceptions

Now if life was a thing that money coulda buy
Then the rich man would make war and the poor man would fight
The rich mother would pity while the poor mother would cry
While the rich make excuses and the poor people die

Type a thing make I wanna go run and hide
Back to me condo over off of Rodeo Dr.
Grab a beer, try to remember a verse from the Bible
Put on me Tivo and see who's off American Idol

Where do they go?
When it rains
Where do they go?
When it snows
Where do they go?
When the cold winds blow
Where do they go?
When we are warm behind closed doorsLes jours de ma vie s'en vont
Sans que j'aie pu retenir une leçon
Je sais que l'amour est là
Infiniment troublant, attendant d'être vu
Quand viennent les coups de grisou
La vie demande tant de vous
Je me demande à quels vents de l'enfer
Une fois, j'ai obéi tout bas

J'ai eu des temps de folie
Des temps d'horreur et des nuits d'oubli
Quand on sait l'angoisse là
Infiniment cruelle, attendant la curée

Le monde est doux dehors
Doux, doux, doux dehors
Et fou dedans
Fugitif et lent
Flou d'abord
Doux, doux, doux, dehors
Fou de sang
Vous entrez dedans
Mais jamais, vous n'en sortez comme avant

J'ai regretté d'être aveugle souvent
Quand l'amour me regardait
Infiniment patient, attendant d'être vu

La trace de mes poisons
Moi, je la porte sur mon front
Je sais que la vie s'en va
Infiniment plus belle qu'on ne l'imagina

Le monde est doux dehors
Doux, doux, doux dehors
Et fou dedans
Fugitif et lent
Flou d'abord
Doux, doux, doux, dehors
Tout le temps
Éternellement

Le monde est doux dehors
Doux, doux, doux dehors
Et fou dedans
Fugitif et lent
Flou d'abord
Doux, doux, doux, dehors
Tout le temps
Éternellement

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Doux dehors, fou dedans

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Doux dehors, fou dedans

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Doux dehors, fou dedans

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Doux dehors, fou dedans

Doux dehors, fou dedans
Doux dehors, fou dedans[Chorus]
Let's walk a-that-a-way not a-this-a-way
That-a-way we can be alone
Take they're throwing our chance to kiss away
This-a-way only leads to home

Notice that we're coming to the crossroads
Should we turn to left or right?
Mother is a-rockin' and a-waitin'
But it's such a lovely night

[Chorus]

Well, don't you think the valley road is shorter?
We could save about a mile
And now and then the short road can be longer
If you linger for a while

[Chorus]

Can't you see the night is just beginning
And the moonlight weaves a spell
We can take the road among the daisies
You know daisies never tell

[Chorus]

I got an awful lot of tender words to whisper
Little ol' words like 'I love you'
Everything you say is so convincing
Yes, that's what we ought to do

[Chorus]
Leads to home
That-a-way only leads to homeCon cada beso que me das
Yo te quiero más y más
Todos los besitos que me has dado tú
Siempre están conmigo

Los tengo aquí en mi corazón
Para recordarme
Lo mucho que me quieres tú
Y lo mucho que te quiero yo a ti

Necesito tus besitos cada noche, cada día
Dime, amorcito que yo soy tu alegría
Dime, cariñito que yo soy la dueña de tu corazón

Necesito tus besitos cada noche, cada día
Dime, amorcito que yo soy tu alegría
Dime, cariñito que yo soy la dueña de tu corazón

Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby says good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

A dazzling place I never knew

It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world (Every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (Every moment, red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

That's where we'll be (That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and meFirst you say you do
And then you don't
And then you say you will
And then you won't
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do? 
Now you want to play
And then it's no
And when you say you'll stay
That's when you go
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do? 
I've been sitting on a fence
And it doesn't make much sense
'Cause you keep me in suspense
And you know it
Then you promise to return
When you don't
I really burn
Well, I guess I'll never learn
And I show it
If you've got a heart
And if you're kind
Then don't keep us apart
Make up your mind
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
Trying to forget you is just a waste of time

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

All day long, wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up the smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

Now that I put it all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart
Nothing left for me, ain't there nothing left for me

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, listen, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

I was wrong, and I just can't live

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me[Repeat: x3]

I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Waiting here
For you to call me
For you to tell me
That everything's a big mistake

Waiting here
In this rainfall
Feeling so small
This dream was not suppose to break

I'm so sorry now
For the pain I caused you
Wont you please forgive
Please

But you don't love me anymore
You don't want me anymore
There's a sign on your door
No vacancy, just emptiness
Without your love
I'm homeless

In this cold
I'm walking aimless
Feeling helpless
Without a shelter from the storm

In my heart
I miss you so much
Missing your touch
And the bed that used to be so warm

I'm so sorry now
For the pain I caused you
Wont you please forgive
Please

Me and my drumWhen they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
"Darling, I love you!"
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguineJesus Christ was a man that traveled through the land
Hard working man and brave
He said to the rich, "Give your goods to the poor"
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave
Yes, Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
Laid poor Jesus in His grave

He went to the preacher, He went to the sheriff
Told them all the same
"Sell all of your jewelry and give it to the poor"
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave

When Jesus come to town, all the working folks around
Believed what he did say
The bankers and the preachers, they nailed Him on the cross
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

And the working people followed him around
Singing and shouting gay
But the cops and soldiers nailed him in the air
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

Well the people held their breath when they heard about his death
Everybody wondered why
It was the landlord and the soldiers that they hired
To nail Jesus Christ in the sky

This song was made in New York City
Of rich man and preachers, and slaves
If Jesus was to preach like He preached in Galillee
They would lay Jesus Christ in His grave

Yes, Jesus was a man and a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
As laid poor Jesus in His graveSteady, are you ready? (are you ready?)

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

[Repeat Chorus]The old home town looks the same 
As I step down from the train,
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa.
Down the road I look and there runs Mary 
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.

It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
Yes, they'll all come to meet me, arms reaching, smiling sweetly.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

The old house is still standing tho' the paint is cracked and dry,
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on.
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary, 
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

Then I awake and look around me, 
At four grey walls that surround me 
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming.
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre,
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.
Again I touch the green, green grass of home.

Yes, they'll all come to see me 
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.All I wanted was your time
All you ever gave me was tomorrow
All I wanted was your time
All you ever gave me was tomorrow
[chorus]
And tomorrow never comes
Tomorrow never comes
Tomorrow never comes
Tomorrow never comes
Tomorrow never comes
People stood in a line with flowers
They were only waiting for the moment
And I know the feeling so well
I've been waiting for you for so long
And I know the feeling so well
I've been waiting for you for so long
[chorus]Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.Train's speeding over the tracks
I can't see through the fog
I can't see where you're at

Take every sin from your heart
And put it to good use
Let it out from the start

Oh I got you
Oh I need you
It's easy to believe what you do

Oh I got you
Oh I need you
It's easy to believe in the truth

We'll tear the air from your lungs
The picture isn't clear
Doesn't show anyone

Black turns to gray in the sun
It always fades away
The colors bleed and they run

Oh I got you
Oh I need you
It's easy to believe what you do

Oh I got you
Oh I need you
It's easy to believe in the truthQué linda está la mañana

Baby, I know I'll never find you again

Baby, baby, I
Walk in the late night
Looking for your eyes
Put up a fight to find you
Lose it every time
You were the last of your kind
All of the blame's mine

And I remember you told me
That we could work it all out, don't you worry
And now the tears in your eyes make it blurry
But if you say, "Try again", I'd be ready
I'm ready, yeah

Have mercy on me, please
I messed up to the third degree
This crush is kind of crushing me

what would you like to be,
now that you're not a kid any more?
I know just what to say,
I answer right a away.
There's just one thing 
I've been wishing for.
 
I wanna be Bobby's girl, 
I wanna be Bobby's girl.
That's the most important thing to me.
And if I was Bobby's girl;
if I was Bobby's girl,
what a faithful, thankful girl I'd be.
 
Each night I sit at home
hoping that he will phone,
but I know Bobby has someone else.
Still in my heart I pray,
there soon will come a day
when I will have him all to myself.

I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say, "Hello"
Oh, you wished me well, you couldn't tell

That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you
Then you said, "So long"
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me
And I'll always be

I know it's somebody's birthday,
Right now, right, right now
Somebody getting drunk too
Right now, right, right now
Fetch me in the club like I own that place
Shorty dancing like she own it
Bad bitches never hold back
Send me a picture with your phone

I only came here for two reasons
I came by
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
For the bitches, came for
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
Baby can you get some
Only came for the bitches and the drinks
Baby get your ass up
That's why I came forIt all started nine years ago
You sat to my left back in school
The future showed itself to me
The god in you, the god in me, stood together like two trees

I was so shy to inquire
If you would like tea sometime
Then in my Mercury
Hand on hand, hand on knee, mercy mercy mercy me

And I believe in love 
To be the center of all things
And I believe in love to be the way
And I believe in love
To be the center of all things
And I believe in love to be the way
To find our inner light

I saw a vision where we
Were opening presents Christmas Day 
But we were not all alone 
The wedding was shotgun 
We had a daughter and a son 

So how cruel to realize 
You had a woman all the time 
But my love burns bright as the sun 
The clouds may come, the clouds may go 
And I'll still be here at your door 

And I believe in love...

Thank you for waiting through my lovers 
Knowing we could come home to each other 
Yes, I have waited through these winters
My true one was right here

And I believe in love...You know I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
You know I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
I don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself

You know you caught me crawlin', baby, when the, when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now, baby, until the day I die
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
Don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself

You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window, baby
Wanna crawl up to your door; you got anything I want, baby?
Wanna crawl up on your floor
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den

You know you caught me crawlin', baby, when the, when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now, baby, until the day I die
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my denI can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out of the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

And his promise made was never clear
It just carve itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my hand
On the night he said to me

Someday
We'll live like horses
Free rein
From you old iron fences
There's more ways than one
To regain your senses
Break out the stalls
And we'll live like horses

We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the tribe
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of the wagon train
On the road to the golden gate
On the flat dry dessert I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now I shall be free

Someday
We'll live like horses
Free rein
From you old iron fences
There's more ways than one
To regain your senses
Break out the stalls
And we'll live like horsesSheepdog, standing in the rain

Some kind of happiness is 
Measured out in miles 
What makes you think you're 
Something special when you smile

Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands 
Some kind of innocence is 
Measured out in years 
You don't know what it's like 
To listen to your fears
 
You can talk to me 
You can talk to me 
You can talk to me 
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

You look just like an angel but you haven't got wings,

I'd rather have you just the way that you are
Than change you for somebody new.
Maybe I could do better if I reached for a star,
But I'm satisfied with you.

You're not made out of candy
But you're as sweet as you can be
So I'm satisfied with you.
I just can't see no reason why you bother with me,
But I'm satisfied with you.

I often wonder if it's all a mistake
It's hard to believe that it's true.
But If I'm only dreaming, I sure don't want to wake,
'Cause I'm satisfied with you.
I'm satisfied with you.Brewing alternatives

Or are we throughEarly in the morning sunlight 
Soaring on the wings of dawn 
Here I'll live and die with my wings in the sky 
And I won't come down no more 

Higher than a bird I'm flying 
Crimson skies of ice and fire 
Borne on wings of steel I have so much to feel 
And I won't come down no more 

Sail on, sail on, I will rise each day to meet the dawn 
So high, so high 
I've climbed the mountains of the sky 
Without my wings you know I'd surely die 
I found my freedom flyin' high 
I've climbed the mountains of the sky 

Floating on a cloud of amber 
Searching for the rainbow's end 
Earth's so far below me, 
I'm here alone,  
I won't come down no moreRomeo: Yeah, yeah, yeah

I may be your forgotten son
Who wandered off at twenty-one
It's sad to find myself at home
Without you
If I could only hold your hand
And say I'm sorry, yes I am
I'm sure you'll really understand
Oh Mammy

Oh Mammy, oh Mammy Mammy Blue
Oh Mammy Blue
Oh Mammy, oh Mammy Mammy Blue

Je suis parti un soir d'été
Sans dire un mot sans t'embrasser
Sans un regard sur le passé-é
Dès que j'ai franchi la frontière
Le vent soufflait plus fort qu'hier
Quand j'étais près de toi ma mère-è-re

Oh Mammy, oh Mammy Mammy Blue
Oh Mammy Blue
Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again
Just to be with you
Just to be with you
There is nothing I wouldn`t do
Just to be with you.

I`d climb a mountain or sail the seas
I`d go a thousand miles upon my knees
I`d find a rainbow and take it from the sky
I`ll be a slave till the day I die.

Chorus:

I`ll build a castle,like those of old,
And I would fill it with wealth untold,
I`d find the lion,compose a symphony,
I`ll count the stars in the galaxy.Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Oh, everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin', baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose

Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well, worries and trouble, darling, babe, you know I've had my share

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin', baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose

Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well, worries and trouble darling, babe, you know I've had my shareThe shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smileI was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground

Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you downI figured it out 
I was high and low and everything in between
I was wicked and wild but baby you know what I mean
'Til there was you yeah you 
Something went wrong 
I made a deal with the devil for an empty I.O.U. 
Been to hell and back but an angel was looking through 
It was you yeah you 
It's all because of you
 
You are the reason 
You are the reason I wake up every day 
And sleep through the night 
You are the reason, the reason 
In the middle of the night (in the middle of the night)
I'm going down 'cause I adore you 
I want to floor you 
I'm giving it up 

No more running around spinning my wheel
You came out of my dream and you made it real
I know what I feel 

It's you 
It's all because of you 

You are the reason 
You are the reason I wake up every day 
And sleep through the night 
You are the reason, the reason 
In the middle of the night (in the middle of the night)
I'm going down 'cause I want you 
I want to touch you 
I want to floor you 
You are the reason, baby 

You are the reason (baby)
You are the reason I wake up every day 
And sleep through the night 
You are the reason, the reason

(You are the reason)
You are the only reason
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
You are the reason, (oh yeah) the reason
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh yeah
Oh (you are the reason) oh yeah
Ooh, the reason

Because of you, emotional, oohThere exists no dream worth chasing if it cannot satisfy
There exists no god worth serving if he cannot hear your cry

Dig your claws into the earth
Struggle to obtain
Holding on for all you're worth
To what death will strip away

Your wealth (your pride)
Dissolved (in time)
Reduced (to dust)
Your worthless treasures rust

A camel through the needle's eye
For greed express no shame
You own no wealth that will provide
Salvation from hell's flames

Your wealth (your pride)
Dissolved (in time)
Reduced (to dust)
Your worthless treasures rust

Constructing towers in the mud
Your labor is in vain
Although it seems progress is made
The outcome is the sameThey told you in school about freedom 
But when you try to be free they never let ya 
They said "it's easy , nothing to it" 
And now the army's out to get ya 
Sixty nine America in terminal stasis 
The air's so thick it's like drowning in molasses 
I'm sick and tired of paying these dues 
And I'm finally getting hip to the American ruse 

I learned to say the pledge of allegiance 
Before they beat me bloody down at the station 
They haven't got a word out of me since 
I got a billion years probation 

Sixty nine America in terminal stasis 
The air's so thick it's like drowning in molasses 
I'm sick and tired of paying these dues 
And I'm sick to my guts of the American ruse
Phony stars, oh no! crummy cars, oh no! 
Cheap guitars, oh no! Joe's primitive bar... nah! 

Rock'em back, Sonic ! 
The way they pull you over it's suspicious 
Yeah, for something that just ain't your fault 
If you complain they're gonna get vicious 
Kick in the teeth and charge you with assault
Yeah, but I can see the chickens coming home to roost 
Young people everywhere are gonna cook their goose 
Lots of kids are working to get rid of these blues 
Cause everybody's sick of the American ruse 

Well well well , take a look around ! 
Well well well , take a look around ! 
Well well well , take a look around ! 
Well well well , take a look around ! 
Well well well , take a look around !Yea good to go

But I've Never Seen A Dance Like This (Bogle)
I've Seen Nuff Dance Before (Keeva And Stacy)
But A Dah One Yah Come Top Di LisI am far from what I've been
A new world for me to see
All precious things that I have seen
Look simple and so small to me

All banners waved are set aflame
As mountains rise in front me
No mercy and no one to blame
For the darkness I will to see

With every aspect of my soul
I am longing for relief
From this darkest certainty
I wish I could believe

Every second I seek answers
To the question that has none
That has to remain unanswered
Until we are gone

With every hour that I spend
On exploring this terrain
Fear is growing, ever onward
How long can I stand this pain?

With every aspect of my soul
I am longing for relief
From this darkest certainty
I just wish I could believe

That there will be something
After bodies cease to be
The fear that there could be nothing
Is paralysing meLately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbyeLook over here....look over there
Look all around me everywhere
Well it doesn't really matter
Which way i want to go

'Cause the night is a fallin'
And I'm a long long way from home
I am a long long way from home, yes i am

Listen to this... listen to that
People tryin' to tell me
Where it's at
But it really doesn't matter

I hear it all the time
And I'm standing at the crossroads
'bout to move on down the line

About to move on down the line

Well I've been over here... been over there
Friends all around me everywhere
But it really doesn't matter
Which way i want to go

I'm a million miles from nowhere
And that's a long long way from home
And that's a long long way from home

Yeah a million miles from nowhere
And that's a long long way from home
And that's a long long way from homeFirestorm genocide
Kill them all before they kill you
Radiation overkill
Apocalyptic truth of the year one (666)

Ghettoblaster, megatron, kill!

Firepower final war
Heading for the infernal reign
Raining blood mushroom clouds
Rats, insects, vomit and agony

Ghettoblaster, nervegas, kill!

Kill, f*cking kill!
Make them f*cking die
Kill, f*cking kill

Kill, f*cking kill!

As history turns the new page

The year scum will be blown away

Ghettoblaster, apocalypse, kill!I can't undo the day
It won't go under the rug
I pull out all the stops
And you pull the plug

These are sober days and I know it can't be
But I'll miss you the way you miss the sea

Don't look down
Keep staring like you've never seen the stars
If you need me to remind you who you are
Little blossom there's the shiniest soul
Just behind those eyes

'No longer my affair'
Well I can't go there just yet
So I've come to love and trust those friends
That are holding your net

Falling off used to mean
Maybe grazing a knee
And I'll miss you the way you miss the sea

Don't look down
Keep staring like you've never seen the stars
If you need me to remind you who you are
Little blossom there's the shiniest soul
Just behind these eyes

While I won't second guess
What you're thinking of me
I will miss you the way you miss the seaWhen the sun is high
In the afternoon sky
You can always find something to do

But from dusk till dawn
As the clock ticks on
Something happens to you

In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and you think about the man
And never ever think of counting sheep

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be his if only he would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss him most of all

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be his if only he would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss him most of allZanim powiesz jej, ze

Pass the hookahGrow up children, don't you suffer
At the hands of one another
If you like a sleeping demon
Listen can you hear him weeping
Tears of joy and tears of sorrow
He buys love to sell tomorrow

My life ain't no holiday
I've been through the point of no return
I've seen what a man can do
I've seen all the hate of a woman too

Feel your heartbeat lose the rhythm
He can't touch the world we live in
Life is short but love is strong
There lies a hope that I have found
And if you try you'll find it too
Remember why I'm telling you

My life ain't no holiday
I've been through the point of no return
I've seen what a man can do
I've seen all the hate of a woman too

And they gave him away
Like in 'Whistle Down The Wind'
By the look on his face
He never gave inI'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I've gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just want to stay

What have I become?
Lookin' through your phone now, oh, now
Love to you is just a game
Look what I've done
Dialing up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

(Tell me how do you)
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you)

Oh no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself

Look what I've done now
Dialin' up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? (oh)
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you)Take away, the scent of flowers
Cover up, the sky of blue
Close my ears to tender love songs
They remind me too much of you

Hide young lovers warm embraces
Keep stars and moonlight from my view
Let me forget, there are such places
They remind me too much of you

Must I evermore be haunted?
Day after day, my whole life through
By the memory of each moment
That I spent alone with you

If these lovely things don't hurt you
Our love just wasn't meant to be
But please come back to me, my darling

If they remind you, too much of meChuh (laugh)

But I just close my eyes and let it be 
Now she walks by me like she never met me 
I didn't even make a memory 

For I was under the influence of love 
I wonder now what I was thinking of 
Yes I was so in love I let her 
Hurtin' me though I knew better 
Under the influence of love 

Why did I let her do me like she done me 
Why can't I get that woman off my mind 
Although I know she never truly loved me 
I wish she break my heart just one time 

For I was under the influence of love 
I wonder now what I was thinking of 
Yes I was so in love I let her 
Hurtin' me though I knew better 
Under the influence of love[Instrumental]

I've got those lovesick blues
And I feel it more than ever
A sinking in my chest like a ship in the blue, do do do do
She was the drug I abused
I feel a rising fever
A shaking in my sleep left me broken and bruised, do do do do

She said "you're just a let down,
Another one of my mistakes,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I never will"
She said "you're just a let down,
All your friends,
They feel the same,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I never will"

I've got those lovesick blues
'Cause I sold my soul to the devil
She was well dressed and she knew what to do, do do do do
I'm painted crimson and blue
She was a ruthless artist
I traded my skin for cheap sex and tattoos, do do do do

She said "you're just a let down,
Another one of my mistakes,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I never will..."
She said "you're just a let down,
All your friends,
They feel the same,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I, I never will, I never will"

She sealed my fate with her conniving sugar kissin'
I took the bait, she told me I didn't know what I was missing
She sealed my fate with her conniving sugar kissin'
I took the bait, she told me I didn't know what I was missing

She said, "You're just a let down,
Another one of my mistakes,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did and I never will"
She said, "You're just a let down,
I finally found the nerve to say,
I never loved you anyway,
I never did, I never will, I never will"

She sealed my fate with her conniving sugar kissin'
I took the bait, she told me I didn't know what I was missing
She sealed my fate with her conniving sugar kissin'
I took the bait, she told me I didn't know what I was missingWhat I wanna say now is a message for the people
Who have storms in your life, we gotta work it out
Let me say it once now then again for those who need it
In these troubled times, let's try to work it out

Anybody ask you tell 'em you don't need a reason
To believe me now, we're gonna work it out
And if you want me then I'll tell them
Like you told me a hundred thousand times we can work it out

Maybe you know how it feels
Maybe sometimes it all comes down to what is real
It ain't always what it seems
Still it's better to believe than to have seen

Let me get you say now with as much as you can feel it
In your own design, we can work it out
Don't you be afraid, child, ain't no reason to conceal it
This is your good time, let's try to work it out
If the spirit moves ya, let it lose ya in the groove of what you know is right

Do you know what I mean?
Is it something you just can't receive?
And it's not what it seems
Still it's better to believe than to have seen

Do you know what I mean?
When I say it comes down to what is real
Maybe it's not what it seems, oh yeah

Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe
Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe

Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe
Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe

Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe

Annie had a baby, can't work no more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Annie had a baby, can't work no more
Every time she start to working
She has to stop to walk the baby 'cross the floor

She had to walk with the baby
Instead of me
Talk to the baby
Instead of me
Sing to the baby
Instead of me
Cling to the baby
Instead of me
Now I know I know Annie understood
That's what's happens when the game gets good

[chorus]If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

He came to town like a midwinter storm
He rode through the fields, so handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was having some fun

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

He brought disaster wherever he went
The hearts of the girls was to Hell, broken, sent
They all ran away so nobody would know
And left only men 'cause of Cotton-Eye Joe

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?

I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?I've been dreaming all those years
I've been sleeping for so long
In a diamond sky of lonely worlds

All your eyes stare up at me
As if I was wide awake
And I only can live my own curse

I will keep your dream
Make it live for real
Only just for a moment

I will send a dying rose
For you all to be close
To its scent that has never been

All the colors to unfold
All the magic we behold
In the life we share in fantasy

I will keep your dream
Make it live for real
Only just for a moment
Say these words again
Don't leave me alone
When my own dreams have finally died

Keep my dream now
I keep yours forever
Save my hope now
I save yours forever
Hold me, help me
Carry me upon your wings
To save my soul with your love

I will keep your dream
Make it live for real
Only just for a moment
Say these words again
Don't leave me alone
When my own dreams have finally died

Keep my dreams now
I keep yours forever
Save my hope now
I save yours forever
