I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying I love you

I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself what a wonderful worldPatchanka

So when you gonna let me
When you gonna let me out

How do you get up
Get up

'Cause driving won't do it
Flying won't do it
Denying won't do it
Crying won't drown it out
What you said

When I'm standing on the yellow line
Waiting at the station
Or I'm late for work
A vital presentation
If you call me now girl
Without reservation
I would try to break through

How do you get up from an all time low
I'm in pieces
It seems like peace is
The only thing I never know
How do you get up from an all time low

How do I choose between my head and heart

Tearing and breaking down
Tearing my heartI took a real good look deep down in my soul
I had been knocked down
I was down for the count or so it seemed
I didn't know which way to go
But by the grace of God
He lifted me up
And my faith was restored

Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound
Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound

I didn't know what to do or where to go to
I was in a really dark place
The answer was here all along
And that's why I wrote this song
To tell you about my Jesus and my faith
The stories in the Bible
And about the grand love that Jesus has for us all

Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound
Said once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound

(Repeat first verse after guitar solo)

Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound
Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound
Yes I'm heaven bound
Yes I'm heaven bound
Thanks for the dinner, thanks for the wine
It's been a hell of an evening and I've had a good time
And now that it's over, well let's get it straight
Don't think that I'm stupid, that I took the bait
I know you're in trouble and you're on the mat
So before you get busy, well here's where it's at

[Chorus]
Where were you when I needed you
Where were you at the fall
Where were you when the light went out
You were nowhere at all

Danny's a junkie and Susie's on bail
And Jimmy's still there in that Mexican jail
And while you've been sitting with your face in your food
Lucy's out there in that Norwegian wood
You think you've got troubles, well what do you know
And as for the favour you know where to go

[Chorus]

You were the hero, you were the best
I was the fool that got left with the mess
And while you were living it up on the coast
Yours truly was stuck here with a room full of ghosts
So hear what I tell you, you miserable clown
We're all gonna help you, on your way down

[Chorus: x2]Hey, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam

Yesterday I got a letter from my friend
Fighting in Vietnam
And this is what he had to say
'Tell all my friends that I'll be coming home soon
My time it'll be up some time in June
Don't forget, he said to tell my sweet Mary
Her golden lips as sweet as cherries

And it came from
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam

It was just the next day his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from Vietnam
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the USA 
And this is what she wrote and said

Se que aun no es tarde para recapacitar 
Se que nuestro amor es verdadero 
Y con los años que me quedan por vivir 
Demostraré cuanto te quiero

Con los años que me quedan
Yo viviré por darte amor 
Borrando cada dolor
Con besos llenos de pasión
Y como te amé por vez primera

Con los años que me quedan 
Te haré olvidar cualquier error 
No quise herirte, mi amor 
Sabes que eres mi adoración 
Y lo serás mi vida entera 

No puedo imaginar vivir sin ti 
No quiero recordar como te perdí
Quizás fue inmadurez de mi parte 
No te supe querer 
Y te aseguro que los años que me quedan (los años que me quedan)
Los voy a dedicar a ti 
Hacerte tan feliz
Que te enamores mas de mi
Yo te amaré hasta que muera

Como comprobar que no soy quien fui 
El tiempo te dirá, si tienes fe en mi
Que como yo te amé
Mas nadie
Te podrá amar jamás 
Dime que no es el final 

Se que aun me queda una oportunidad
Se que aun no es tarde para recapacitar

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries "Nay! Nay!" to me
And people declare "You're through!",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
Oh I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,
There's a shadow hanging over me,
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know. She wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday,
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh I believe in yesterdayTunak tunak tun

Gonna get the feeling that I'm going insane
Feel so stupid using these old cliche's
You better hurry up Baby, I ain't lying
We're down to nothing but a waste of time
Still remember everything she said
Make no promises and make no debts
All I want is just a one day weekend love
She sips her wine without a flinching
She's in control of it all the way
Looks so good, pretending that she's listening
By the time I fall asleep, she's gone away
She's got no mercy on a jealous heart
And she said it all right from the start
Make no promises and make no debts
But I love that lady, I got to confess
I want more than just a one day weekend love
All she wants is just my one day weekend love
I want more than just a one day weekend love
All she wants is just my one day weekend loveNo one else compares when she's around
There's magic everywhere
I still can't believe
That she's in love with me

She's poetry that don't rhyme
Colors outside all the lines
So sweet she could make an angel weep
Her spirit cannot be tamed
She's beautiful that way
Though it seems she's a dream

That's just Emily

Does she even know?
That rainbows end is everywhere she goes
I think, I say her name
A million times a day

She's poetry that don't rhyme
Colors outside all the lines
So sweet she could make an angel weep
Her spirit cannot be tamed
She's beautiful that way
Though it seems she's a dream

That's just Emily

(Oh I'm tired, servicible villain
Set you down father, rest you)I've got to know, yes, I've got to know, friend;
Hungry lips ask me wherever I go!
Comrades and friends all falling around me
I've got to know, yes, I've got to know.

Why do your war boats ride on my waters?
Why do your death bombs fall from my skies?
Why do you burn my farm and my town down?
I've got to know, friend, I've got to know!

What makes your boats haul death to my people?
Nitro blockbusters, big cannons and guns?
Why doesn't your ship bring food and some clothing?
I've sure got to know, folks, I've sure got to know!

Why can't my two hands get a good pay job?
I can still plow, plant, I can still sow!
Why did your lawbook chase me off my good land?
I'd sure like to know, friend, I've just got to know!

What good work did you do, sir, I'd like to ask you,
To give you my money right out of my hands?
I built your big house here to hide from my people,
Why you crave to hide so, I'd love to know!

You keep me in jail and you lock me in prison,
Your hospital's jammed and your crazyhouse full,
What made your cop kill my trade union worker?
You'll hafta talk plain 'cause I sure have to know!

Why can't I get work and cash my big paycheck?
Why can't I buy things in your place and your store?
Why do you close my plant down and starve all my buddies?
I'm asking you, sir, 'cause I've sure got to know!



I saw her walking down the street he jumped down,
He knocked her off her feet and then I knew it was the end of her

He's gonna kill that girl He's gonna kill that girl
He's gonna kill that girl tonight

When I saw her walking down the street my heart stood still and skipped
A beat then he knocked her on the floor but he wanted just a little bit more

He's gonna kill that girl He's gonna kill that girl

When I saw her walking down the street my heart stood still and skipped

When I saw her walking down the street my heart stood still and skipped
A beat then he knocked her on the floor but he wanted just a little bit moreThey painting the churches to cover the time that's passed
It's the 12th of December and the snow on the ground 
As the city gets one last laugh, turns the lights out.

It was easy to bury the wickedness in my heart, 
Was no one else sorry, could no one else see 
That the ghosts they left behind,
Will not forget them I love you so long.

I could not change my mind
I won't forget you
I would not want to 

Now it's dark on the corner, it's dark where we used to walk 
But I still remember the streets and the bars, 
The parks and the winter coats.
But the words escape me, they ringing the bells out 
Be sure that they ring for you.

It's all disconnected but if this blame for the fall 
And the blame did not fall on you
They took your chances I love you so long

I could not change my mind I wont forget you
I would not want to 
I could not change my mind
I would not want to 

You've always been ready to leave when you get accused
And I guess I am no different I guess we are the same 
And I guess that you are guessed it tooQuiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating in the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams, and a window
looking on the mountains and the sea.
How lovely! this is where i want to be.
Here, with you so close to me, untill the final flicker of lifes ember.
I who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you
The meaning of existence oh, my love.Suzy was nine and I was ten 
Right at the time when boys like to think they're men 
She used to follow us at school 
We really thought that she was a little fool

Mama said "Look, she's never done you no harm 
So get off her back and let her be 
Why can't you play together in harmony?" 
We really didn't know what to say 
But as soon as she went away 
We laughed and said

Let's go MLOh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!You have become 
What you have always been 
Light flickering around 
Peripheral vision 
No words we can speak 
Of paths to be chosen 
All trails that we trek 
Shall lead us back to here 
Because our

Love comes again 
Just when I've broken down I found 
Love can come again 
You gotta believe that 
Love comes again 
Just when I've broken down I found 
Love can come again 

Deep within me 
Turn all the secret stones 
Forests and fields 
Breathing with blood and bones 
Still no words we can speak 
Of paths to be chosen 
All trails that we trek 
Shall lead us back to here 
Because our

Love comes again 
Just when I've broken down I found 
Love can come again 
You gotta believe that 
Love comes again 
Just when I've broken down I found 
Love can come againUm cantinho e um violão
Este amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama

Muita calma pra pensar
E ter tempo pra sonhar

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

O que é felicidade, o que é felicidadeIl y a dans tes yeux
Comme un air curieux
Il y a dans tes yeux
Qui parfois sont vitreux
La force vive de celles et ceux
Qui en ont bavé plus que pour deux
Il y a tout ça dans tes yeux
Il y a tout ça

Bien sûr s'est dur d'être heureux
Le bonheur se cache souvent
Ne nous effleure que quand il veut
Peut-être parce qu'il est méfiant
Peureux, craintif ou défaillant
Preneur de tangentes et déviant
Qu'il nous compisse d'un jet tournant
C'est vrai, c'est vrai
Le bonheur, hum s'il vous plaît

Bien sûr on s'cache pour pleurer
Bien sûr rien n'est moins sûr que la vérité
Elle assassine sans tuer
Et laisse à vif, écorché
Y'a trop d'froideur dans trop d'foyers
Tant d'bassesses et d'aigreurs pour nous fourvoyer
Peut-être qu'on fuit la vérité
C'est vrai, c'est vrai
La vérité, la vérité

Il y a dans tes yeux

Il y a dans tes yeux
Qui parfois sont vitreux
La force vive de celles et ceux
Qui en ont bavé plus que pour deux
Il y a tout ça dans tes yeux
Il y a tout ça

Bien sûr la vie est hasardeuse
Tellement trop courte et capricieuse
Injuste, odorante et visqueuse
C'est peut-être une auto-stoppeuse
Déroutante excitante farfelue et farceuse
Jonchée d'épines et de courbes délicieuses
Peut-être même que c'est une chieuse
C'est vrai, c'est vrai
Bien sûr que la vie est précieuse

Bien sûr être seul c'est rude
Bien sûr à deux on est plus fort
Bien sûr que j'y crois encore
Bien sûr que l'amour est plus fort que la mort
Y'a des doutes et des gouttes qui perlent sur nos fronts
Des certitudes écurantes qui nous plombent vers le fond
Peut-être qu'on est des bouffons
C'est vrai, c'est vrai
Mais je n'veux plus être un pigeon

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark

Once riding in old Baltimore, head filled,
Heart filled with glee
I saw a Baltimore an keep looking straight at me
Now I was eight and very small
And he was no whit bigger
And so I smiled but he poked out his tongue and called me a n*gger
I saw the whole of Baltimore from May until December
Of all the things that happened there
That's all that I remember

Who's so scared
When I was fourteen I took a bus to San Francisco
I was full of hope and joy till this girl called me a boy
But I was already on my way so frightened to be gay
Just like in 1942 (1492) the world screaming,
"Something's wrong with you, Jew"

Who's so scared
But what I discover,
Lover after lover
There's nothing wrong with me
That's just a lie by society
So I start looking at the world we have
And while it's not all bad,
There's a lot of room for improvement
People of color and the gay movement

Who's so scared
Won't you explain to me that pain of your lifeI`ve offered you all I have 
Just to spend my life with you (Just to be with you) 
But someone`s got a claim on me 
These few hours will have to do 
So hold me tight, let`s make this night last forever 

Cos in the cold light of day, baby 
I`ll be going on my way 
You`re good for me, baby, but we met to late 
And I`ve got so much love to give 
And I`ve just got to learn to live 
Without you 

How could we know the time would come 
When you and I would feel this way (Just to be with you) 
Love started as a playful thing 
Just turned out a different way 
So clock on the wall 
Please don`t tick at all 
Just stand still 

Cos in the cold light of day, baby 
I`ll be going on my way 
You`re good for me, baby, but we met to late 
And I`ve got so much love to give 
And I`ve just got to learn to live 
Without you 

In the cold light of day baby 
I`ll be going on my way (repeat 2x) 
It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still.

It had to be you, wonderful you

It had to be you.You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to meAs a means of release
Pick up my little pieces of heaven
'Tis a social disease when I cry
As you head for the door
I want it all, you can take it all leave it

With the light coming in
My desire to give in runs away with me
If I'm not good enough and my love is too much
Then forget it
Now I am strong carry me home
You can take it or leave it

God help me but forgive my true intention
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run
All this time still falling out of love

As we cut to the thrust
This could well be the year of decision
Do you know what I mean
Like a song spinning round in my head?
Now I am strong carry me home
You can take it or leave it

God help me but forgive my true intention
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run
All this time still falling out of love

I want it all, give me it all
I want it all, give me it all

God help me but forgive my true intention
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run
God help me but forgive my true intention
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run
All this time still falling out of love
All this time still falling out of loveToo low to find my way
Too high to wonder why
I've touched this place before
Somewhere in another time
Now I can hear the sun
The clouds drifting through the blinds
A half a million thoughts
Are flowing through my mind

A satellite recalled your voice
Sent me round the world again
All the night you've dreamt away
Sent me round my heart again
One touch upon my lips
And all my thoughts are clear
I feel your smoky mist
Up to the stratosphere

Too low to find my way
Too high to wonder why
I've touched this place before
Somewhere in another time
Now I can hear the sun
The clouds drifting through the blinds
A half a million thoughts
Are flowing through my mind

Too low to find my way
Too high to wonder why
I've touched this place before
Somewhere in another time
Now I can hear the sun
The clouds drifting through the blinds
A half a million thoughts
Are flowing through my mind

Too low to find my way
Too high to wonder why
I've touched this place before
Somewhere in another time
Now I can hear the sunEu vivo sem saber
Até quando ainda estou vivo
Sem saber o calibre do perigo
Eu não sei
da onde vem o tiro

Por que caminhos você vai e volta
Aonde você nunca vai
Em que esquina você nunca para
a que horas você nunca sai
Há quanto tempo você sente medo
Quantos amigos você já perdeu
entrincheirado, vivendo em segredo
e ainda diz que não é problema seu

E a vida já não é mais vida
no caos ninguém é cidadão
as promessas foram esquecidas
não há estado, nao há mais nação
perdido em números de guerra
rezando por dias de paz
não vê que sua vida que se encerra
com uma nota curta nos jornais.I'd wait for you
I'd slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move
The earth for you
To prove my love, dear
And its worth for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along.

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you darling
Come what may
My heart is yours
What more can I say?

I'd lie for you
I'd sigh for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you baby
Come what may
My heart is yours
What more can I say?

I'd lie for you
I'd cry for you
I'd lay my body down and die tor you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes alongReally don't mind if you sit this one out.
 
My words but a whisper your deafness a SHOUT.
I may make you feel but I can't make you think.
Your sperm's in the gutter your love's in the sink.
So you ride yourselves over the fields and
You make all your animal deals and
Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.
And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away in
The tidal destruction
The moral melee.
The elastic retreat rings the close of play as the last wave uncovers
The newfangled way.
But your new shoes are worn at the heels and
Your suntan does rapidly peel and
Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.
 
And the love that I feel is so far away:
I'm a bad dream that I just had today and you
Shake your head and
Say it's a shame.
 
Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth.
Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth.
Spin me down the long ages, let them sing the song.These are just the simple facts, I will relate to you
Though they are not connected, each and every one is true
If they seem a bit untidy, well, unraveling them is fun
I will not stand corrected, I have not harmed anyone

I just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride

Better I listen to my heart, I sometimes fail to find
One sane and simple answer on the bright side of my mind
Even when I'm sleeping, I can't seem to unwind
I just let it ride

I knew a man from Windsor who went to Detroit every night
And stateside of the tunnel customs agents gave him flight
He threw his stash in the river and his bedroll on the ground
And when they finally got there, a sleeping man was all that they found

He just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leave on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride

Hear the steeple bell ring out above my lobster pots
I might be out here fishin' man but that ain't where it stops
The mouths I feed are many and they all say thanks a lot
They just let it ride

One day when I'm old and gray an' consider what's gone by
I always will be proud of every tear I've ever cried
And all of the old jokes we told around the candle light
To all those tender damsels who had helped us in the night

They just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride
I'm gonna let it ride

Here's to the girls from London and the ones from Montreal
We never will forget them, we still fantasize them all
I knew one in St. Louis on a Missouri afternoon
I met one up in Shanghai and another in Rangoon

I just let it ride
Ride, let it ride
Leave on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride

Ride, ride, ride
I'm gonna let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride
Has there ever come a time, when you fell real nice
And you want to let someone know that you really appreciate them?
All you have to do is moan a little bit for me,
It goes something like this
Ooooh, ooooh, oooooh, oooooh.

You see, no time for wasting, baby,
We're gone all through those moves
I'm offering satisfaction, darling,
Girl, I'm giving you all my love,
Anytime is the right time, baby,
Come on and, take my heart
It's all yours if you want it, baby,
My heart is tearing all apart, I say

Ooooh (you can have it)
Yeah (if you want it)
Come and get it, baby,
But if you want it (you can have it)
Come and get it, girl, yeah (if you want it), yeah.
See darling - there's no time for wasting, baby,
Come on please, make up your mind.
Good loving is so pleasing, baby,
Girl, I'm giving you all my time.
You can have it if you want it
Just come and get it, and, baby, it's yours, yeah.
I've got it to give and if you want it.
I know that you're gonna love it, so come on, girl.
Oh, I knew you'd like it,
Oh baby, you got me saying something like
Oooooh, ooooho.

One night while I was sleeping, baby,
Had a dream of you and I,
Found myself asking you, baby,
Take my hand and be my wife.

There's no time for wasting, baby,
Cause we've gone all through these moves
Cause I'm offering satisfaction, darling,
Girl, I'm giving you all my love.

You can have it, yeah, if you want it.
You can have it (baby, you really want my loving)
If you want it (it's all yours, baby)
You can have it any time of the day if you want it.

Don't matter what place it is, baby, you can get it, baby.
You can have it (come on, girl, and get it)
If you want it you can have it
(cause I will make you feel alright)
If you want it (can't you tell that)
You can have it (take my heart)
If you want it (come on, darling)
You can have it (take my heart)
If you want it (satisfaction guaranteed)
You can have it (take my heart)
If you want it you can have it (take my heart)
If you want it.Mr. Christopher Columbus

Well, when his men began a rumpus
Up spoke Christopher Columbus

He said, "There is land somewhere

If we sing a swing song
Since the world is round we'll be safe and sound
Till our goal is found we'll just keep the rhythm bound"

Then came a yell, let's drink to Isabella

Her name, Mary Jane

Saggin' my dickies, smoke like a hippy
Smell so good when she get wet and sticky
You lift me, girl you the bomb
Got a nigga blowin' like Cheech and Chong
A bong, a blunt, or a paper square
It really don't matter she'll take you there
You been my gal since the age of thirteen
And it's funny to me, you still make me fiend
You put a spell on me with the green voodoo
You love when my boys come and run us a choo choo
Mary-Jane deep in the game
The way I feel words can't explain
You been true to me, stood by my side
I wake up and get my mornings first high
Other hoes wonder why they get no love
'Cause Mary got a big ol' but, huh

[Chorus: x2]
Mary-go-round, round and round
Oh let the Mary-go-round, pass the sweet

If yous a Jane user
Throw your hands in the air with this muthaf*ckin three time user
Producer, wanna cool my future (pass the sweet)
Pass the Medusa, I never knews her
Who ya, who ya think ya are
Ya f*ckin with a dopehouse shootin' star

Smokin' that budda
Drinkin' that puda
Booya, another killa from madulas
I thug in rida chick gets me higher
There's no needa tryna find a finer hyna
I decya my bitch your fya
Be bestet as we kids under plya

[Chorus: x2]

Mary-go-round round and round
Oh let the Mary-go-round
Pass the sweet

Now you can do snow or get wet as the rain
Me man I got Jane in my brain
Of course I kick doors for white whores
But my wife Mary-Jane I never get divorced
'Cause she be tha only one fit for a playa
The green eyes and the pretty red hair
The hoes sick cause them jealous bitches wanna
Vyla coma vana marijuana
You was born in Mexico but I took the chance
And brought your ass across to the promise lands
I love to lay you down so soft in my swisha
Act like a freak and let all my niggaz hit ya
I got your picture on all my walls
Mama caught us kissin' wanna call the laws
My family thinks you nothin' but trouble
Can't see how you helped me through the struggle

[Chorus: x2]I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap
Left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash

I did it for the girl
Dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss
I did it for the girl

I dialed her up some more George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge
Big sky turnin' red
That perfect night she said she can't forget

I did it for the girl
Dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss
I did it for the girl

I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her

I did it for the girl
Dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss
I did it for the girl

Dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt, pull me through the front door
Did it for the midnight, candlelight, anything to make her mine
All mine
I did it for the girl
I did it for the girlHer name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind 

At the copa don't fall in love 
Don't fall in loveWhat would I give for just a few moments
What would I give just to have you near
Tell me you would try to slip away somehow
Oh I need you darling I want to see you right now
Can you slip away, slip away
Slip away, oh I need you so
Oh love oh love, how sweet it is
When you still involve it
Let me tell you how sweet it is
Now I know it's wrong,
The things I ask you to do
But please believe me darling
I don't mean to hurt you
But can you slip away
Without him knowin you're gone
Baby we could meet somewhere,
Somewhere we both are not known
Can you slip away, slip away,
Slip away-ay-ay-ay I need you so
Oh can you slip away baby
I'd like to see you right now darling
Can you slip away baby
Cause I got to, got to see you
I feel a deep burning inside
Oh I wish you could slip away...
The party's over, it's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
It's time to wind up the masquerade
Just make your mind up
The piper must be paid

The party's over, the candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night
It seemed to be right just being with him
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

The party's over, it's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

It's all over, my friendBaby, baby, can't you see what you're doing to me?
I couldn't sleep a wink last night just a-thinking of you
Baby things weren't right I kept on tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'  tossin' and turnin' all night
I threw the blankets on the floor, turned my pillow upside down
Then I thought of you some more
And I kept on tossin' and turnin' turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night
Jumped out of bed, turned on the light
Pulled down the shade went to the kitchen for a bite
Pulled up the shade, turned off the light
I jumped back into bed it was the middle of the night
The clock downstairs was striking four, couldn't get you off my mind
Heard the milkman at the door but I was tossin' and turnin'Saturday to sunday's waste 
Then monday's soon around 
It's always time to leave 
The nightlife first
And catch the last bus out of town
And the sentiment of the last song that I heard 
Stays with me as if I'd written every word

I thought I saw an open door 
With a bright light shining through
But what it was I don't recall
But I think you've seen it too
And there are the days and the ways I've known 
Dreaming that this bird has flown

And if you burnt your fingers in the fire
Remember me and my desire

It might be easier this way
If you're trying to change the world

I saw a film just made for me
Said you've got to walk the line 
The day will come when I feed the flames 
I'm just biding my time
These are the days and the ways I've known 
Dreaming that this bird has flownThey call it stormy Monday, but Tuesday's just as bad
They call it stormy Monday, but Tuesday's just as bad
Wednesday's worse, and Thursday's also sad

Yes the eagle flies on Friday, and Saturday I go out to play
Eagle flies on Friday, and Saturday I go out to play
Sunday I go to church, then I kneel down and pray

Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, my heart's in misery
Crazy about my baby, yes, send her back to meLittle Wheels Spin and Spin Big wheels turn around & around (4x)

Merry Christmas Jingle Bells
Christ is born and the devil's in hell
hearts they shrink Pockets swell
Everybody know and nobody tell 
Little Wheels Spin and Spin Big wheels turn around & around (4x)

Oh the sins of Caesar's men
cry the pious citizens 
who petty thieve the 5 & 10s
and the big wheels turn around and around 
Little Wheels Spin and Spin Big wheels turn around & around (4x)

Blame the angels, blame the fates, 
Blame the Jews or your sister Kate
Teach your children how to hate
and the big wheels turn around and around 
Little Wheels Spin and Spin Big wheels turn around & around (4x)

Turn your back on weeds you've hoed
silly sinful seeds you've sowed
Add your straw to the camel's load
Pray like hell when your world explode 
Little Wheels Spin and Spin Big wheels turn around & around (4x)

Swing your girl fiddler say
Later on the piper pay
Do see do, swing and sway
Dead will dance on judgement day 
Little Wheels Spin and Spin Big wheels turn around & around (4x)
You went away, I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind

Still the magic if the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind
The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love

This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away

This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I grow lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to meForever you're my foundation
I know I can keep
Told I was good for nothing
Branded a cheat
Now I know why you listen
I can help you anytime
Love is all there is
I wonder what you people do with your lives
Hey!
Oh! I wonder what you people do with your lives
Once more this will be forever

I can't withhold secrets
I know I'm going where the sun always shines
I know my son we've made it
It can't escape my mind
I know my star is a brighter star. brighter star
Forever be in my arms

This could be a myth in the making
Under a spell
Down to ambition
I guess you could even call it a miracle 
I see my true love coming
My little bundle of joy
I can help you realise

It's us and us only
I know I'm as good as my neighbour
A starter for ten
I can't promise I will always be with you
I promise I'll always be there
Oh! I wonder what you people do with your lives!

When you find it, you'll feel it
I'll give you all of my love
Hold it, Don't lose it, misuse it
As long as you believe enough
My mind is multiplying
I have so much to give
I wouldn't estimate you for the way that you want to live

Inside the bullring
The bullocks all start trembling
They know I'm coming
I'm Don Alfonso
Some call me Pedro
But that is not so
I'm Don Alfonso
I fought bullocks out in sunny Spain
Out in sunny Spain
I fought bulls in the sunshine
And I fought them in the rain

I work for Oxo
And all the bullocks are afraid of me
Oh, my sword I pull
Kill zi bull!
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full
Then we have steak and chips for tea
I met a sweet señora
In Barcelona
Her christian name was Mona
She was thumbs-up bona
She told me she was single
That made me tingle
My heart went jingle, jingle
I said "Let's mingle"

Night now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready
For a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and
The gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth

[Chorus]
Everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got in too deep and I could not pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bough us two tickets on that Coast City bus

[Chorus]

Now our luck may have died and out love may
Be cold but with you forever I'll stay
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
So put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold and maybe everything dies
That's a fact but maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back

Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm
Gonna do a little favor for him
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday

Why'know they won't be home tonight, ooh
The snow falls hard and don't you know? 
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true, ooh
They carry news that must get through
They choose the path where no one goes

They hold no quarter, 
They hold no quarter, aaaah

Walking side by side with death 
The devil mocks their every step, ooh 
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more, oh 
They carry news that must get through 
To build a dream for me and you
They choose the path where no one goes 

They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Aaah! The pain without quarter 
Ooh, when I'm callin'' callin'' callin' 
They need no quarter, aaaah

The dogs of doom are howlin' more
Give me quarter
I hear the dogs of doom a howlin moreLet me tell you about a girl I know
Had a drink about a hour ago
Sitting in a corner by herself, in a bar in downtown hell

She heard a noise and she looked through the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes, a double-chin and a plastic smile
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
"My brand new car is parked right outside
How'd ya like to go for a ride?"
And she said "Wait a minute I have to think"
He said, "That's fine. May I please buy you a drink"
One drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car
And they drove away someplace real far

Now babe the time has come
How'd ya like to have a little fun?
And she said "if we could only please be on our way, I will not run"

That's when things got out of control
She didn't want to, he had his way
She said, "let's go"
He said, "no way!"
Come on babe it's your lucky day
Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way
Come on baby don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape I'd never get laid

He finished up and he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said "now baby don't be sad, in my opinion you weren't half-bad"
She picked up a rock, threw it at the car, hit him in the head, now he's got a big scar
Come on party people won't you listen to me
Date rape stylee

The next day she went to her drawer, look up her local attorney at law
Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed, "she lies that little slut!"
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him twenty five years
And now his eyes are filled wit tears
One night in jail it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries

That's when things got out of control
The moral of the date rape story, it does not pay to be drunk and horny
But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind

But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind
Date rape!

She didn't want to, she didn't want to, she didn't want to, she didn't want to
Take it!When I was young my father said
'Son I have something to say'
And what he told me I'll never forget
Until my dying days

[Chorus:]
He said son you are a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son you'll be a bachelor boy
Until your dying days

When I was 16 I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as can be
But I remembered just in time
What my daddy said to me

[Chorus]

As time goes by I probably will
Meet a girl and fall in love
Then I'll get married have a wife and a child
And they'll be my turtle doves

But until then I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay
Happy to be a bachelor boy
Until my dying daysThis happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through
Your window
I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see
Your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
And I saw you walk in
Your door
I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place

If I were you, I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before, when you gave me no reply

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
And I saw you walk in
Your door
I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place
No reply
No replyClose the city and tell the people that something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, oh

You've nothing to say
They're breaking away
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
The mob rules

Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, oh

It's over, it's done
The end is begun
If you listen to fools
The mob rules

You've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to fools

Break the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back around

You're all fools
The mob rulesSabe, estou louco pra te ver
Oh, yes
Cabe, entre nós dois um querer
E mesmo ao passar do tempo hei de ter
Você junto a mim
Nada se compara a esse prazer
Arder sem fim
Vou gozar, delirar
Se com você sonhar
Conquistar esse amor
Que não se acabará

Oh yes, oh yes

Olha, eu te amo e quero tanto
Beijar teu corpo nu
Não, não é mentira, 
Nem hipocrisia, é amor
Com você tudo fica blueSabe, estou louco pra te ver

Com você tudo fica blueTonight's the night in your arms again
Be the one to make me whole
And then say whatever you have to say to me on and honestly

Every single thought of you amazes me
So I'll promise you, I'll promise you to me
(Every single time that you've forgiven me)

To find the one with your heart and stem
Freed and mine much more than the rest of them
Seed the chance to grow and be with me
The way I know and see

There you are in my thoughts again
Fearing all we have is dead
Taken time as the best of friends
Please don't let me down againThere's something going
In the air tonight
And we all know why it is
Kids are boppin' around
We're all feeling allright
And we all know why it is
What's the use in stayin'
At the status quo ?
Dare to go !

[Chorus:]
Something's flying in the air tonight
Something all the kids wanna do
Go stagedivin' in the air tonight
Dare to go !

I know some bigshots who complain
About the kids who dive
And I don't know why they do it
Feel free to dive when we're playin' live
Can't see no reason not to do it
What's the use in fighting
In the front now ?
Dare to go !

[Chorus]

don't mind your face when you're in the boppin' race
Jump off the stage
Like a kangaroo in a rage !

[Chorus]

--ContriButed By Adnan.I.MOld man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kissThis lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smilechorus:

On the passenger's seat? 

I would go out tonight 
But I haven't got a stitch to wear 
This man said "it's gruesome 
That someone so handsome should care"

Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy 
Who never knew his place 
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things 
He knows so much about these things

If youre coming around again tell me how you feel cause I need to know.
I could be your love again if you just let me in.
We dont have to work it out cause I already knowI skimmed across black water
Without once submerging
Onto the banks of an urban morning
That hungers the first light
Much, much more than mountains ever do

And she, like a ghost beside me
Goes down with the ease of a dolphin
And emerges unlearned, unshamed, unharmed
For she is the perfect creature, natural in every feature
And I am the geek with the alchemists' stone

For all of you who must discover
For all who seek to understand
For having left the path of others
You'll find a very special hand

And it is a holy thing
And it is a precious time
And it is the only way
Forget-me-nots among the snow
It's always been, and so it goes
To ponder his death and his life eternally

For all of you who must discover
For all who seek to understand
For having left the path of others
You'll find a very special hand

And it is a holy thing
And it is a precious time
And it is the only way
Forget-me-nots among the snow
It's always been, and so it goes
To ponder his death and his life eternally

One bright blue rose outlives all those
Two thousand years, and still it goes
To ponder his death and his life eternallyI don't know what I'm to say 
You can't hear me anyway 
And does it really even matter if we play? Hey hey hey 
I don't know what I'm to do 
To get those pleasantries from you 
But if you'll be my princess Lela that's OKAlmost blue, almost doing things we used to do
There's a boy here and he's almost you
Almost all the things that your eyes once promised
I see in his too, now your eyes are red from crying

Almost blue, flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be

Almost blue, it's almost touching, it will almost do
There is a part of me that's always true, always
Not all good things come to an end now it is only a chosen few
I've seen such an unhappy couple

Almost me, almost you, almost blueYou know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, "And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair." 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air. 
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair.Victory or die!
What do you say, what can I ever do for you?
What are we gonna to do to pass the time?
What do you care when you find that life's unfair?
Equality is just a state of mind
Believe whatever is right
What's right for you tonight
You know where to draw the line
What have you done, what's in your mind, what do you need?
Where shall we go to let it out?
What have you seen, we don't know where you've been
Life so often blows your candle out
Believe in what is right, what's right for you tonight
Who knows what the f*ck it's all about?
Look up and see the flying saucers cruising in the sky
I saw one myself, it ain't no lie
Look down and see the road you're on
As if you run a marathon
That's the spirit, victory or die

What did they say, what have we learned, what do we know?
What shall we do to even up the score?
What do you find, if you find that you've got blind?
Darkness is a thing we've seen before
Believing is your right, all right
Whatever makes you right
You always end up on the killing floor
'Cause now they see the soldiers, see them marching off to war
Taking care for [?]
Never hears what they don't know, what they f*cking do
That's the spirit, victory or die
Watch out for the monsters, and the eyes of the night
They're always hungry, look them in the eye
They are looking at your daughters
They've seen the flying saucers
You have to tell them victory or die
Or dieDeceived, by the light, now I'm blind
Descending, into the void, misguided souls

Worship, turned to lunacy, and wrath
Killing spree, in the kingdom, of Christ 

If you see the faces, the fear, the anger
Turned into oppressive lies
Ridden with disease, despise, and hatred
Enter the realm of revelation nausea

To bear the cross, to tell the lies
A rape of Christ, is your demise
The purest soul, beyond the sky
So kneel for me, or you'll die

Another carcass, on a cross, decomposing
Rise above, to resurrect, I'm Christ

If you see the faces, the fear, the anger
Turned into oppressive lies
Ridden with disease, despite, and hatred
Revelation nauseaSilently approaching creeping through the night
Shadows below the radar hide from unsuspecting light
You can't see it coming but you feel it near
The eminent destruction pulls you down in the fear

Now the fight has just begun
The battle is not over
You're scared it's been won

Find the enemy (silent)
Lying in your bed

I can see the dark clouds looming up above the land
Picking up on the signals of connotations
I don't understand
They tell me things nightmares are made of

Pictures straight from hell
Try to put it all in a bag by the wayside
But I know I will failIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying ho?
You know I'm the man ho?

You ain't nothing but a creeper, I'm just saying, though
Saying, though

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

Creeping on the low, hope your man don't see ya
She will bust it down for some damn Lime-A-Ritas
Chew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda
Gotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas
Baby, you can't hold back, stop flexing like you not
Your man tryna patrol that I guess he is a cop
But he really can't cuff if he busting at my spot
But I done had enough cause you making my shit hot
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass 'bout that?
Tryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?
Can you play around with that mouth while he hit it from the back?
You can't say nothing now 'cause we all been through with that, through with that

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying, ho?
You know I'm the man, ho?

Pass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, ¡Andale!

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off (Cut that bitch off)
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off (Cut that bitch off)Oh me oh my oh you
Whatever shall I do?
Hallelujah,
The question is peculiar
I'd give a lot of dough
If only I could know
The answer to my question
Is it yes or is it no?

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Here comes a blushing bride
The groom is by her side
Up to the altar,
Just as steady as Gibraltar
The groom has got the ring
And it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger
The choir begins to sing:

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Now the nation rise as one
To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent
The bonny burning question,
What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?
Boom boom

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?

On the bedpost overnight
Hello there,
I love you and
The one who holds you tight!
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Sat'day night
On the bedpost overnight
A dollar is a dollar & a dime is a dime!
He'd sing another chorus
But he hasn't got the time

Silence sea and sky
Innocent as the child
Always asking why
I can take you there
I can show you
I can take you there
I'll be there
Gently catching you as you fall
Hearing you when you call
Smiling as we climb
Smiling crocodiling
Certainly as the sun
Bakes a Sahara day
Ancient as the hills
Crumbling into clay.
I can take you there
(Rest of chorus)
It's pleasure and pain
No loss no gain
Pleasure and pain
Again and again
Pleasure and pain.
I can take you there
(Rest of chorus)
This madness, this laughter
Outward feelings I can't control
Those coloured lights are leading me

If you leave me, I'll go crazy

'Cause I love you, love you
Oh, I love you too muchBack in the old days when gangsters were all the rage
And crime was the front page of news and TV....
A group known to no one who's blows were all low ones
The cops had shit to go on they had no leads....

Drive by shootings
Murders at will...
Pay for protection
Or have yourself killed...

Gangbusters...

Guys like Al Capone who loved being unknown
Made themselves at home and still got away...
The law couldn't catch him or none of his hit men
So he died in prison for taxes unpaid...

Screw prohibition
Crimes go unsolved
Elliot Ness
Couldn't wrap up the mob...

Hey Ho- Who the gangbusters
Hey yo- You the gangbusters
That's Right- We the gangbusters...

Some say crime don't pay but they didn't feel that way
And so I would have to say that I do agree...
The gangbusters in the past proved they were there to last
By knife or shotgun blast for the world to see[Chorus]
I thank you
For helping me through the storm
I thank you
For helping me carry on through the storm

It's been a long time coming
And the world keep turning round... through the storm
When the world give you love
It's turn for love
It fills your soul

[Chorus]

Day after day
Week after week
Month after month
Turn into a year

[Chorus]

I've been through so many changes
But somehow I hold on
I don't know where
Don't know where to go
But I'mma keep holding on, baby

Day after day
Week after week
Month after month
Turn into a year

I thank you
I'm gonna keep on holding on
I, I'm gonna keep on holding on to my chance
Oh!

[Chorus]

I thank you
Oh baby
I, I really thank you
Come on darling
I thank you
I thank you
For your love that you given me
The whole timeNão adianta nem me abandonar 
Porque mistério sempre há de pintar por aí 
Pessoas até muito mais vão lhe amar 
Até muito mais difíceis que eu pra você 
Que eu, que dois, que dez, que dez milhões 
Todos iguais 

Até que nem tanto esotérico assim 
Se eu sou algo incompreensível 
Meu Deus é mais 
Mistério sempre há de pintar por aí 

Não adianta nem me abandonar 
Nem ficar tão apaixonada 
Que nada, que não sabe nada 
Que morre afogada por mimCanto al pie de tu ventana
Pa que sepas que te quiero
Tu a mi no me quieres nada
Pero yo por ti me muero

Dicen que ando muy errado
Que despierte de mis sueños
Pero se han equivocado
Porque yo he de ser tu dueño

Que voy a hacer
Si de veras te quiero 
Ya te adore 
why olvidarte no puedo

Dicen que pa conseguirte
Necesito una fortuna
Que debo del cielo 
Las estrellas why la luna

Yo no bajare la luna
Ni las estrellas tampoco
why aunque no tengo fortuna
Me querrás poquito a poco

Que voy a hacer
Si de veras te quiero
Ya te adore 
why olvidarte no puedo

Yo se que hay muchas mujeres
why que sobra quien me quiera
Pero ninguna me importa
Solo pienso en ti morena

Mi corazón te ha escogido
why llorar no quiero verlo
El pobre mucho ha sufrido
Ahora tienes que quererlo

Que voy a hacer
Si de veras te quiero
Ya te adore 
why olvidarte no puedo
RVYou are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 
I feel like this is the beginning

Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you? 

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

Love has joined us
Love has joined us
Let's think sweet loveI should be filling rooms with the sweet smell of success
I'm a mess look at what I've been reduced to
I don't blame you for sayin' no when you should have said yes
But darlin', darlin', darlin', look at me now I'm a mess

I'm a mess, I'm a wreck
I'm really on the deck
I'm a mess, look at how I'm living
Some of these days I'm gonna get back on my feet and quit this blue address
But darlin', darlin', darlin', in the meantime I'm a mess

The smart set, I used to run around with are invisible now
They all cut me loose when one said that what I've got might just rub of on
Them somehow
I'm a mess, for want of your caress
Darlin', darlin', darlin', look at me now I'm a messI'm in love with a German film star 
I once saw in a bar 
Sitting in a corner in imperfect clothes 
Trying not to pose 
For the cameras and the girls 
It's a glamorous world 

I'm in love with a German film star 
I once saw in a movie 
Playing the part of a real troublemaker 
But I didn't care 
It really moved me, it really moved me 

I'm in love with a German film star 
I once saw in a bar

I'm in love with a German film star 
I once saw in a movie 
Playing the part of a real troublemaker 
But I didn't care

I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love. 
I'm in love.How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?Dear, it's a lot like the way that we don't talk
Every day that I'm away I will be there
In the parking lot with the drugs we bought
The hope I had

I haven't got a prayer
I haven't got a prayer
And you're small and feeling used
Just stare and stay confused

Don't say what we've become
And, dear, I promise you
A change is overdue
By the time that I arrive I will be done

Whatever I do
Whatever I say to make you feel better
And every hour of every day it's all I ever
Hand me your hope

Just stay together
And they're all down with watching you drown
It's now or never here
It's about the things you see when you figure out

What the hell is going on
Bury me beneath the overpass and the empty streets
It's  better when I'm gone
And in the dark you say my name

I call you and you came
And it's more than I can bear
You're lost and left alone
And hope is never home

What's wrong is everywhere
Ask me I'm sure I'll tell you how we sing together now
And it leaves me
Ask her

I'm sure she'll tell you more
Just sing it like before
Believe me
Believe meOne is a spirit of Christmas
It is the celebration of the birth of the Christ child!
This we will never forget!
Oh, this we will never forget!
But there are other little things too!
Yes, there are other little things too!

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,
Jack Frost nipping at your nose,
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways:
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas to you! Merry Christmas to you!
To you!
Merry Christmas everybody and a Happy New Year!
To you!Fue más o menos así 
Vino blanco noche viejas canciones 
Y se reía de mi 
Dulce embustera 
La maldita primavera 
Que queda de un sueño erótico si 
De repente me despierto y te has ido 
Siento el vacío de ti 
Me desespera 
Como si el amor doliera 
Y aunque no quiera 
Sin quererlo pienso en ti

Si para enamorarme ahora 
Volverá a mi la maldita primavera 
Que importa si 
Para enamorarme pasa una hora 
Pasa ligera 
La maldita primavera
Pasa ligera 
Me hace daño solo a mi 

Lo que a su paso dejó 
Es un beso que no pasa de un beso 
Una caricia que no 
Suena sincera 
Un te quiero y no te quiero 
Y aunque no quiera 
Sin quererlo pienso en mi

Si para enamorarme ahora 
Volviera a mi 
La maldita primavera 
Que importa si 
Para enamorarme pasa una hora 
Pasa ligera 
La maldita primavera 
Pasa ligera me maldice solo a miI've been swallowed by your kindness
Every part of me is breaking down
You have let me feel so helpless
As if I couldn't drown

It was all with love
You understood the need in me
So much tenderness
You wrapped in humanity

You touched my soul
My very being
You made me whole
Now life has new meaning
Gotta a second chance
You can see the change in me
And as we dance
You wrap me in humanity

Others walked on by in their blindness
But you refused to let me be
My disguise you saw behind this
You pushed on in and set me free

And it was in protection
You held on with such certainty
Embraced by your affection
As you wrapped me in humanity

You touched my soul
My very being
You made me whole
Now life has new meaning
Gotta a second chance
You can see the change in me
And as we dance
You wrap me in humanityI can't sleep at night
I can't eat a bite
'Cause the man I love
He don't treat me right

He makes me feel so blue
I don't know what to do
Sometime I sit and sigh
And then begin to cry
'Cause my best friend
Said his last goodbye

There's a change in the ocean
Change in the deep blue sea, my baby
I'll tell you folks, there ain't no change in me
My love for that man will always be

Now I can read his letters
I sure can't read his mind
I thought he's lovin' me
He's leavin' all the time
Now I see my poor love was blind

Now I got the crazy blues
Since my baby went away
I ain't got no time to lose
I must find him today

Now the doctor's gonna do all that he can
But what you're gonna need is an undertaker man
I ain't had nothin' but bad news
Now I got the crazy blues

I should have quit you, long time ago. 
I wouldn't be here, my children, down on this killin' floor.

I should have listened, baby, to my second mind 
I should have listened, baby, to my second mind 
Every time I go away and leave you, darling, you send me the blues way down the line.

Said, people worry I can't keep you satisfied.
Let me tell you baby, you ain't nothin' but a two-bit, no-good jive.

Went to sleep last night, worked as hard as I can,
Bring home my money, you take my money, give it to another man.
I should have quit you, baby, such a long time ago.
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles, down on this killing floor.

Squeeze me baby, till the juice runs down my leg. 
Squeeze me baby, till the juice runs down my leg. 
The way you squeeze my lemon, I'm gonna fall right out of bed.

I'm gonna leave my children down on this killing floorOh the wind whistles down
The cold dark street tonight
And the people they were dancing
To the music vibe

And the boys chase the girls, with curls in their hair
While the shocked too many sit way over there
And the songs get louder each one better than before

And you singing the song thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you singing the song thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight

So you're heading down the road in your taxi for 4
And you're waiting outside jimmy's front door
But nobody's in and nobody's home till 4
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
Talking about Robert Ragger and his 1 leg crew
And where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?

And you singing the song thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you singing the song thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?

Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonightThe tears I cried for you could fill an ocean,
But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me,
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

I told myself it's best that I forget you,
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I'd come running back for more

Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

Someday you'll find someone you really care for
And if her love should prove to be untrue,
You'll know how much this heart of my is breakin'
You'll cry for her the way I cried for you

Yes, everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's foolWipe those tears away from your eyes.
Just take my hand, you don't have to cry.
It'll be alright. Baby, I'll make it alright.

Don't let the world get you down.
Reach for the love that is all around.
It'll be alright. Baby, we'll make it alright.

I'll pick you up when you're feeling down.
I'll put your feet back on solid ground.
I'll pick you up and I'll make you strong.
I'll make you feel like you still belong.

Cause it's alright. It's alright.
Gonna make it alright. Make it alright.
Stay with me tonight. Stay with me tonight.

Sometimes the words, well, that's just not enough.
Afraid of feelings and in need of love to 
make it alright. Baby, I'll make it alright.

Where will you run to? Where will you hide?
I know the pain comes from deep down inside.
But it will be allright.
Baby, we'll make it alright, baby!

Let me make it alright. Make it alright.
Let me make it alright. Make it alright.
Stay with me tonight. Stay with me tonight.

Deux curs qui se confondent
Au seuil de l'infini
Loin du reste du monde
Haletant et soumis
A bord du lit
Qui tangue et va
Sous toi et moi

Toi et moi
Libérés des mensonges
Et sevrés des tabous
Quand la nuit se prolonge
Entre râles et remous
Nos songes fous
Inventent un nous

Entre chien et loup dans nos rêves déserts
L'amour a su combler les silences
Et nous ces enfants nus vierges de nos hier
Devenons toi et moi, lavés de nos enfers

Porte-moi
Au-delà des angoisses
A l'appel du désir
Du cur de nos fantasmes
Aux confins du plaisir
Que Dieu créa
Pour toi et moi

J'étais sans espoir et tu as changé mon sort
Offrant à ma vie une autre chance
Les mots ne sont que mots, les tiens vibraient si fort
Qu'en parlant à ma peau ils éveillaient mon corps

Aime-moi
Fais-moi l'amour encore
Encore et parle moi

Aux sources de nos joies
Mes jours se noient

Ah, ah, ah, ahYou promised to love me to the end of the world
And I built a world just for two;
Now I'm alone at the end of the world
What good am I without you?
Gone are the vows that we made by the stars
Gone like a bolt from the blue;
Darlin I'm lost at the end of the world
But what good am I without you?
Now yesterday's love is an old memory
Leaving me so heartsick and so blue;
But where can I turn at the end of the world
And what good is love without you?
So this is the end of a beautiful dream
A dream that can never come true;
I can't go on to the end of the world
For the end of my world's loving you.I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
I came back to ley you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
And they may never find what they dream of

You tried everthing 
But you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see

I can't believe the things I do for you

You've tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

Almost every afternoon we'd play forbidden games
At nine years old there's no such thing as shame

It wasn't recognition of her face, what
Brought me back was a familiar mark
As it flashed across the screen. I
Bought some magazines, some video taped scenes
Incriminating act I felt that I could save her

Who the hell are you to tell me how to live my life?
You think I sell my body; I merely sell my time
I ain't no Cinderella, I ain't waiting for no prince
To save me in fact until just now I was doin' just fine
And on and on

I know what degradation feels like
I felt it on the floor of the factory
Where I worked long before, I took control
Now I answer to me
The 50K I make this year will go anywhere I please
Where's the problem?[Chorus]
All religions make me want to throw up
All religions make me sick
All religions make me want to throw up
All religions suck 
They all claim that they have the truth
That'll set you free
Just give 'em all your money and they'll set you free
Free for a fee 

They all claim that they have 'the Answer'
When they don't even know the question
They're just a bunch of liars
They just want your money
They just want your consciousness

They really make me illI'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for loveWhen we were young the world seemed so old
Careless and cold
We did what we were told in our lives
When we were young
Had the world by the tail
Good would prevail
Starships at sail
And none of us would fail in this life
Not when you're young

We were drawn to whoever could keep us together
And bound by the heavens above
And we tried to survive traveling at the speed of love

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

In a moment of grace
A long leap of faith
The still more glorious dawn awaits
It's my life
I'm here with the lovers

And we burned the bridges
We're crossing over
Just to see the firelight
And the innocent are getting over
Being old tonight

Woah when we were young
When everything was what it seemed
Woah when we were young
And everyday was how we dreamed
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Woah when we were young

And when you look at yourself tonight
Are you someone you recognize?
You can take back what you've given away
But it must be the last time

Woah when we were young
Woah when we were young
When we were young

Woah when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Woah when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Woah when we were young
We didn't know it wouldn't last
Woah when we were young1, 2, 3, 4

Though the days are long
Twilight sings a song
Of a happiness that used to be

Soon my eyes will close
(Soon my eyes will close)
Soon I'll find repose
And in dreams, you're always near to me

I'll see you in my dreams
Hold you in my dreams
Someone took you out of my arms
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light our way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

In the dreary gray
Of another day
You are far away and I am blue

Still I hope and pray
(Still I hope and pray)
Through each weary day
For it brings the night and dreams of you

I'll see you in my dreams
Hold you in my dreams
Someone took you out of my arms
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light our way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams
They will light our way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

Grapevine

But the greatest country singer alive!

Covered with erl
Cause you're a honky, I know, but Merle you got soul
And I'll fix your flat tire Merle

Well I hear you had an adventurous youth, makin' love
In a telephone booth
And I even hear you did a little stretch in jail
But now you got a big ranch house with a bar
And eight, nine, ten of them fancy cars
And every other little check comin' in the mail

I'll fix your flat tire Merle
Don't ya get your sweet country pickin' fingers all
Covered with erl
Cause you're a honky, I know, but Merle you got soul
And I'll fix your flat tire Merle

Long haired kids
And now ya know we don't care what ya think... Merle,
If you're gonna call the world your home
Ya know you're gonna have to get out and get stoned
An' it's better with a joint than with a drink, I think

Covered with erl
Cause you're a honky, I know, but Merle you got soul
And I'll fix your flat tire Merle
So I'll fix your flat tire MerleI'm the man who makes mistakes
I've held my heart and failed to break
Giving everything got nothing to show

But I'm the man who still believes
In things I can and cannot see
Who's not afraid of unfamiliar roads

So I'm gonna go
I'm gonna go
Down that deserted highway
I'm gonna go

I feel the pain with every curve
Maybe I'm getting what I deserve
The guarantee was lost along the way

But I'm a man who's bleeding hope
Quit giving up long ago
To me there's always gonna be some day

So I'm gonna go
I'm gonna go
Ain't no time to stop believing
I'm gonna go
As long as I'm still breathing I'm gonna go
No lights ahead, I'm slowing down
Uncertainty is all around

So I'm gonna go
I'm gonna go
Ain't no time to stop believing
I'm gonna go
As long as I'm still breathing I'm gonna go

Yeah I'm gonna go
I'm gonna go
Ain't no time to stop believing
I'm gonna go
Just as long as I'm still breathing
I'm gonna goAmazi-ing Grace, how-ow sweet the-e sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
I-I was blind, but now, I see

T'was Grace that taught my-why heart to fear
And Grace, my fears re-e-elieved
How precious did tha-at Grace appear
Oh-oh the hour I first be-elieved

When we've, when we've been there
Lord, ten thou-ousand year-ears
Bright shining, bright shining as the su-un
We've no le-ess days to sing Go-od's praise
Then when, we first be-egun

We've no less days to sing Go-od's praise
Then when we first begunLife lands a freshing blow.  And once again our heart is broken.  And as history repeats itself.  These few words are sadly spoken.    I've passed this way before.  I've felt this pain before.  A hurt that took so long to end.  Has found my poor heart again.    As I watch love walking away.  It brings back old memories.  But a familiar pain still feels the same.  Once again, heartache has found me.    A dark cloud covered my heart.  Oh, when she told me goodbye.  Now there's nothing left but emptiness.  And the tears that filled my crying eyes.    I've passed this way before.  I've felt this pain before.  A hurt that took so long to end.  Has found my poor heart again.    No matter how strong a man is.  Without a love he walks in the dark, baby.  If love deserts him it would surely hurt him.  'Cause his weakness is his heart.    A lonely journey now stands before me.  The endless pain has started.  But this time I know the way.  Walking alone and broken hearted.    Because I've passed this way before.  And I've felt this pain before.  A hurt that took so long to end.  Has found my poor heart again.    I've passed this way before.  I've felt this pain before.  A hurt that took so long to end.  Has found my poor heart again.Ännu spelar syrsor

Thinkin' baby, it was time for me to make a move
Late night skyline that's when it hit me
Well, I got to have me some of that New York City

Now, I was leaving San Diego in a Chevrolet van
I, out across the desert into no man's land
I just love the west you know, sure it's pretty
But I got to have me some of that New York City

I've been away too long and I got the itch
To do a little time in the east coast nitch
Down on Broadway and do a little diddy
Smack dab in the middle of New York City, oh yeah

The ocean on my left and the mountains on my right
To leave it all behind sure seemed like a pity
But I got to have me some of that New York City, oh yeah, oh yeahOnce again up in that south from my motherf*cking mouth
And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherf*cking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

[Chorus]

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I f*cked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' f*cked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

Don't sit there mumbling
Talkin' trash

Hey y'all tell everybody! Ray Charles's in town,

I tell y'all I'm gonna let the good times roll now,

If you want to have a ball, you got to get yourself together,
Oh, get yourself under control, woah, and let the good times roll.I remember how it used to be,
and all the things you said to me.
You always taught me right from wrong.
(Wrong from right, right from wrong)
'Til you went on the killing spree,
and killed your family.
Why is this the way things have to be?

Oh Mr. Smiley,
how could it be true,
the things they say that they knew?
I can't believe it! What has happened to you?
I took my time while thinking it through.
Digging through facts, believing in you.
Oh Mr. Smiley. Give me a clue,
why they said it was you,
I can't accept it! Tell me it's not true.
Because you were once so good to me,
oh Mr. Smiley tell me how it could be.

You always had a smile on your face,
I never thought you'd become a criminal case.
Until I saw your face on my TV.
Was it just for entertainment?
Because now you face solitary confinement, in jail.
Why is this the way it has to be? Tell me!

Oh Mr. Smiley, what has happened to you? Tell me it's not true!The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heartOne life, one love

Dreaming badly,
Feeling something's wrong.
Faces crying

As they fade away,
Who can say where they were going.
Where's their song
Did they leave it in

Their hearts too long.
Were they waiting for
A sunny day.
Who can say who's wind is blowing.

I can't wake the wind to blow my way.
Let them shake the world
I know, I know in my way,
I know that songs that died unsung

Know their way too.
Most songs do.
Most songs do.
All night long

Someone's trying,
To believe that he is strong.
Will he make it
By the fade of the day.

Who can say who's power is growing.
I can't wake the wind to blow my way.
Let them shake the world
I know, I know in my way,

I know that songs that died unsung
Know their way too.
Most songs do.
Most songs do.

All night long,
Dreaming badly,
Feeling something's wrong.
Faces crying

As they fade away,
Who can say where they were going.
With this song
Did they leave it in

Their hearts too long.
Were they waiting for
A sunny day.
Who can say who's wind is blowing.

I can't wake the wind to blow my way.
Let them shake the world
I know, I know in my way,
I know that songs that died unsung

Know their way too.
Most songs do.
Most songs do.Hot summer night
Storm lies in the air 
My eyes are a little heavy 
I'm feeling in the past tense
I'm hardly aware

I don't want you on the phone 
don't you play that good girl with me 
Why must I always say it again 

I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
And she's a lot like you 

I tried to wash my face 
But my head fell to low 
I tried to bury myself 
But my mind wouldn't stay at home 

I don't care if you're sitting at home 
somebody has broken into me 
Why must I always say it again 

I got a new girl now 
I got a new girl now 
I got a new girl now 
And she's a lot like you 

I don't want you on the phone 
don't you play good girl with me 
Why must I always say it again 

I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
And she's a lot like youYou know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dreamThe soul of the nation slowly withers (in the howl of the empty wind)
As the spring lays, crushed beneath the hammer (the invisible flame)
My vision sears the crowded square (as the mouth of injustice grins)
This routed place (fire runs through my veins)
I choose to expire
You're all on the brink of compromise(as the steel in my nerve sets in)
Mass concessions in defeated eyes (I carry the cries)
A terrible kindness to break the thrall (in my end a new world begins)
I strike the match (it's not me who dies)
And let it fall
Oppression, injustice, self-immolation
I am the inferno I am legion

Oppression, injustice, self-immolation
I am the inferno I am legion

I am
I am
I am
I am the inferno
I am
I am
I am
I am legion

Some run screaming
Some sit silently
An agonizing gift of charred humanity
My footsteps
They will echo through eternity
A seismic scorching outcry of indignity
I write my blackened name, carved into the wind
I fill your hearts with rage
I leave you ash and legend
Fire runs through my veins
Fire runs through my veins
A terrible kindness to break the thrall (fire runs through my veins)
I strike the match
Fire runs through my veins

Oppression, injustice, self-immolation
I am the inferno I am legion
Oppression, injustice, self-immolation
I am the inferno I am legion

I shall lay charge I am legion
I am the inferno I am legionSing for your tears
A song of the hatred
No one can hear
'Cause your life is forgotten
I want to give my life to you
But my will is tied with puppet strings
I am fighting and screaming alone
Inside this empty room

[Chorus:]
They let you down, threw you in the rain
They let you down, sent you away

The night is dark when you're alone
And sometimes it can be so cruel
The rain keeps falling on me so coldly
'Cause your wishes didn't come true

Nothing seems real anymore
As I dive into the sea of lies
I don't understand this sorrow
That keeps me sane

[Chorus]

Without a name
The let you down

Nothing seems real anymore
As I dive into the sea of lies
I don't understand this sorrow
That keeps me sane.I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents for the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light leads
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
(I'll be home for Christmas)Looks like we have missed this little trend
We're in the same predicament once again
And I know that only one thing's for sure
I know that you have heard all of this before
So think about this when you think you're getting pissed
Don't you think about anything but holding on
Try to realize that even though we've tried
You know that we are no where near far gone
And there's one thing that I just can't understand
How any one can turn on a newly signed band
And maybe all the world will start anew
And maybe one day hard work will all come through
Not me, no, cause I don't want to be a nobody on this level, I want to be star
Don't want to think about all those times they laughed cause we thought we might go far
And still I think it might just be taking us too long
When everything keeps going wrong
I'll keep holding onWho's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocadile feet
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
At the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Gigolo, Huh, sukka?
Gigolo. Gigolo, Huh, sukka? 

Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in every way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me
 
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Get funky. Yeah Timmy
Tell it like it is. Check out this DJ

So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race
Now you're looking at me to take her place

Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in every way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me

No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Smokin', not tokin', get funky sax
Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch
Looking good in a Buffalo Stance
Looking good when it comes to the crunch
Looking good's a state of mind
State of mind don't look behind you
State of mind or you'll be dead
State of mind may I remind you
Bomb the Bass, rock this place!
What is he like? What's he like anyway?
Yo man what do you expect, the guy's a gigolo man
You know what I mean?

No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Wind on my face, sound in my ears
Water from my eyes, and you on my mind
As I sink, diving down deep, deeper into your soul

No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of

No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of

No moneyman can win my love
No moneyman can win my love
No moneyman can win my love
No moneymanSi sbaglia sai quasi continuamente
Sperando di non farsi mai troppo male
Ma quante volte si cade
La vita sai è un filo in equilibrio
E prima o poi ci ritroviamo distanti
Davanti a un bivio
Ed ogni giorno insieme per fare solo un metro in più
Ci vuole tutto il bene
che riusciremo a trovare in ognuno di noi
in ognuno di noi

Ma a volte poi basta un sorriso solo
A sciogliere in noi anche un inverno di gelo
E ripartire da zero, zero
Perché non se è un limite per nessuno
Che dentro se abbia un amore sincero
Solo un respiro

Non siamo angeli in volo venuti dal cielo
Ma gente comune che ama davvero
Gente che vuole un mondo più vero
La gente che incontri per strada in città

Prova e vedrai ci sarà sempre un modo
Dentro di noi per poi riprendere il volo
Verso il sereno
Non siamo angeli in volo venuti dal cielo
Ma gente comune che ama davvero
Gente che vuole un mondo più vero
La gente che insieme lo cambierà
Angeli in volo venuti dal cielo
Ma gente comune che ama davvero
Gente che vuole un mondo più vero
La gente che insieme lo cambierà
Insieme lo cambierà
Insieme ci riuscirà
Lavori lo cambierà
Gente che riuscirà
Insieme ci riuscirà
Gente che cambieràThe way you know me
The way you love me
It's so natural
Can't remember me
Without you

Show everybody
The you that I see
Every day with you
Is like a glimpse of eternity (because)

[Chorus]
What I see through your eyes
Is the promise of forever
Look over my shoulder and you're always there
Come whatever
And I want you to know I never
Take for granted what I have
There's no (wherever I go)
No mistakin' (now that I now)
I'm sayin'

In every part of me (in every part of me)

Ain't no deceivin'
Couldn't conceal it
Quick am I breathin'
Just gets better all the time

The way I know you
The way I love you
Feels so natural
You reach me and I feel the fire

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Being real and just kickin' back
I know in your love there's no lack
And no one ever could argue that
They can try but they won't get nowhere
Fast as the earth turns around
Heaven stands still for right now
You in my heart and no other sound
Anyway, anyhow

The way you love meGod above all the world in motion
God above all my hopes and fears
And I don't care what the world throws at me now

Hear the sounds of the generations
Making loud our freedom song
All in all that the world would know Your name
It's gonna be alright

Cause I know my God saved the day
And I know His word never fails
And I know my God made a way for me
Salvation is here

Salvation is here
Salvation that died just to set me free
Salvation is here
Salvation is here and He lives in me
Salvation is here
Cause You are alive and You live in meBúscame en el fondo de la noche que siempre voy a estar esperándote
Tirame un anzuelo para ver si salimos de una vez de aquí

Que por la boca muere el pez pues por la boca comenzamos
Y si tu tienes que beber de mi que sea de mi de mi de mi

Humilde tiburón para endulzar mi vodka en el bar
Y bailo en altamar encendieron las luces del lugar
Y es hora de sarpar

Que por la boca muere el pez, pues por la boca comenzamos
Y si tu tienes que beber que sea de mi, de mi, de mi

Y un beso camicas casi casi casi casi logra despegar
Y estrellarse en ti y hundirte la boca en la calle
Que viste de luces y erupta espuma del mar en el bar
Para sumergirnos en su remolino

Que por la boca muere el pez pues por la boca comenzamos
Y si tu tienes que beber que sea de mi, de mi, de mi, de mi

Que por la boca muere el pez pues por la boca comenzamos
Y si tu tienes que beber que sea de mi, de mi, de mi

Búscame en el fondo de la noche que siempre voy a estar esperándote
Tirame un anzuelo para ver si salimos de una vez de aquí

Que por la boca 
Que por la boca

Es la resaca de la  mar  es la resaca
Al despertarnos en esa nausea en tu mirar en tu mirar
Te vistes siempre de mi de mi de mi de mi 

Que sea de mi, de mi, de miHow can I see what I'm needing for
How can I give what I gave before
How can you tell me that you want me to stay
How can I stay when I'm trying to say
That I can't live without the rain
Yes I can't live without the rain

How can I feel what I'm trying to feel
How can I move when I'm heel to heel
You're always shouting about the doubt in my eyes
But I can't answer 'cause my eyes are so dry
Now I can't live without the rain
Yes I can't live without the rain

Now I can't live without the rain
That's falling on my head
Rain that's falling on my head
Rain that's falling
Rain that's falling
Rain that's falling on my head

I started thinking back to you know when
I'd like to send a line but then again
How can I write you when there ain't no light?
I'm feeling tired tonight but that is all right
Now I can't live without the rain
Yes I can't live without the rainIsn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next yearOn Monday I wished it was Tuesday night
So I could wish for the weekend to come
On Tuesday I wished that the night would pass
So I could call you on the phone
Now a man can spend a lot of time
Wondering what was on Jack Ruby's mind 
And time is all I have without you here 

On Wednesday when you hung up
It was as much as I could do
To stop from wishing Thursday
Would pass so quickly too
They're out there making history
In the Lenin Shipyards today
And here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away

There's always room for one more soul
Down in the Human Zoo
I don't want you to come here though
I want to come home to you
Somebody's knocking at the door
Its later than I think
And its time to put on these stinking clothes
And get out there and stink

On Friday I wished there was something more
To be seen in the letters you send
On Saturday I wished it was Sunday
Oh will this torment ever end
Sometimes I get a notion to put a torch
To the tools of my trade
Here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away
I know you wanna leave me,
But I refuse to let you go,
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy,
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, 
Please don't leave me, girl, 
Don't you go.
 
Now I've heard a cryin' man
Is half a man with no sense of pride,
But if I have to cry to keep you,
I don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, 
Please don't leave me, girl, 
Don't you go.
 
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away,
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand,
'cause I wanna keep you any way I can.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, 
Please don't leave me, girl, 
Don't you go.
 
Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart,
And each day it grows more and more,
I'm not ashamed to call and plead to you, baby,
If pleading keeps you from walking out that door.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, 
Please don't leave me, girl, 
Don't you go.I know you wanna leave me,
But I refuse to let you go,
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy,
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, 
Please don't leave me, girl, 
Don't you go.
 
Now I've heard a cryin' man
Is half a man with no sense of pride,
But if I have to cry to keep you,
I don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,

Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, 
Please don't leave me, girl, 
Don't you go.I'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you're starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line
Right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, hey

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over

And I'll have to get over you all over again
Over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line
Right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really overAll you want to do is sit around and pout
And now I got enough and so I'm getting out
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I been in the doghouse so doggone long
That when I get a kiss I think that something's wrong
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I'll go find a gal that wants to treat me right
You go get yourself a man that wants to fight
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

You start your jaws a-wagging and it never stops
You never shut your mouth until I blow my top
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I remember back when you were nice and sweet
Things have changed, you'd rather fight than eat
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I'm a-gonna do some riding on the midnight train
I'm taking everything except my ball and chain
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhowI like to dream, yes, yes
Right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near
To the stars away from here

Well, you don't know what
We can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride

Well, you don't know what
We can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free

Close your eyes now
Look inside now
Let the sound
Take you away

Last night I hold Aladdin's lamp
So I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Well, someone came and took the lamp away

I looked
Around
A lousy candle's all I found

Well, you don't know what
We can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride

Well, you don't know what
We can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free

Close your eyes now
Look inside now
Let the sound
Take you awayThe world today is such a wicked thing
Fighting going on between the human race
People give good wishes to all their friends
While people just across the sea are counting the dead

A politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's got to go and die
They can put a man on the moon quite easy
While people here on earth are dying of old diseases

A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
He doesn't even know who is his fatherBaby, look across the street
I know that you're alone
I've been waiting out in the dark
That surrounds your home
'Cause after midnight I'll be calling
C'mon, answer the phone

And baby, you know there's no getaway
I belong with you
I'll be calling every night and day
'Till you want me too

Baby, I've seen every movie
That you've ever made
Now I'm waiting
I know all the parts
That you've ever played

And baby, you know there's no getaway
I belong with you
I'll be calling every night and day
'Till you want me too

Oh baby, do you read my letters
I'm so excited about you
But I'm still waiting, I've had no reply
What about our rendezvous?
'Cause after midnight
Ooh, while you're sleeping
You know I'm looking for you

And baby, you know there's no getaway
I belong with you
I'll be calling every night and day
'Till you want me too
I don't feel alright 
In spite of these comforting sounds 
You make
I don't feel alright 
Because you make promises
That you break
Into your house
Why don't we share our solitude? 
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude
It's hard to make sense
Feels as if I'm sensing you 
Through a lens
If someone else comes
I'll just sit here listening to the drums
Previously I never called it solitude
And probably you know 
All the dirty shows I've put on
Blunted and exhausted like anyone
Honestly I tried to avoid it
Honestly
Back when we were kids, we would always know when to stop
And now all the good kids are 
Messing up
Nobody has gained or 
Accomplished anythingI don't feel alright

That you've been untrue
You've gone and broke my heart
And made me blue
Turned my head around
Then you tore me down
If I had a choice
I'd not be sad
'Cause when I hear your voice
It makes me mad
Baby's not around
But she's leaving town
Baby, baby
Don't run away
I want you to stay
I'm sorry
So sorry
I made you blue
And now you should be sorry too
Should be sorry too
Now I'm so alone
You're far away
I sit here at home
No words to say
To anyone around
'Cause you tore me down

Follow her down to the lake, she takes me back to where I was
Feed the fire, fire the flame, darkness sets in and the rain
As we crawl beneath the ledge and forget why we came
Forget now why we came

If we meet here again I will suffer your pain
I won't let you escape your reflection in the rain
And if we starve as the world spins in circles and burns
I will love you today as the end of the world
As the end of the world

But the darkness becomes beneath us
And the moon rays light the way
As the music becomes softer
There's a light in the house that says

From the night sky she comes, tell one lie and she runs
Follow her down to the lake, she takes me back to where I was
Feed the fire, fire the flame, darkness sets in and the rain
As we crawl beneath the ledge and forget why we came

I will beg, I will kneel, I will borrow, I will steal
Just to have you again just to have you right here
And if we starve as the world spins in circles and burns
I will love you today as the end of the world

As the end of the world
As the end of the world
(As the end of the world)

Seven years old in my radio flyer
And cape tied around my neck
Top of Thompson's Hill
Billy said I was a liar
And now I'm scared half to death

Becky said Billy was dumb
I shouldn't listen to him
But I had something to prove
Ain't nobody gonna call me a chicken
Gotta do what you gotta do

I'm gonna fly
Defy space and gravity
I'm gonna fly
Billy, just you wait and see

I was just a kid
Barely eighteen years
And I couldn't wait to graduate
Confident, cocky and man it really got me
When I heard my daddy say

You oughta get some knowledge
You gotta go to college
Gotta make something of your life
But I had to do it my way
So I headed for the highway
And I followed those little white lines

I'm gonna fly
Defy space and gravity
I'm gonna fly
Makin' my own destiny

Well I crashed and I burned
But I don't regret it
You only fail if you don't try
Gonna brush off the ashes
And just forget it
I ain't perfect, yeah
But you can bet someday
I'm gonna get my wings and fly

I'm gonna fly
Defy space and gravity
I'm gonna fly
Yeah, you just got to believeExcuse me now I've got a call
I'll take this call from Valhalla
Please tell my friends from outer space
You are my son, you'll take my place

And if the revolution comes
I've got some good friends there

Take my place, after all you are my son
You take the moon, I'll take the sun
And by the way if the revolution comes
Please take my rifles, take my guns
A single bullet loaded in each one

And if you don't like my melody
I'll sing it in a major key, I'll sing it very happily
But if everybody is all aboard
Lets take it back to that minor chord

You are my son, you'll take my place
Please tell my friends from outer space
I'll take this call from Valhalla

Excuse me now I've got a call
I've got some good friends there

You take my place because you are my son

Excuse me now, I'll take the sun
I'll take my place in Valhalla
And if the revolution comes
Please take my gun

si es posible vivir en un sueño estando despierto. Si cuanto más despierto me siento, más se alejan mis pies del suelo. La respuesta que busco en tus labios la descubro en tus ojos. Cuando me miran, me lo dicen todo. why maldigo una why mil veces esta distancia que va de tus manos a mis manos. Es entonces cuando más te pienso. Es entonces cuando más te sueño. Es entonces cuando más te quiero. Busco a mi alrededor why no encuentro nada. No veo nada que no sea esta distancia. Nada que no seas tu why esta distancia. Me pregunto why te pregunto, si te puedo tener sin tenerte why tocar sin tocarte. Si es posible no verte why mirarte. Me pregunto why te pregunto, si se puede morir de dolor recordando un instante. O simplemente abrazando tu imagen. Mientras busco entre mis esperanzas la esperanza de nunca perderte. La esperanza en que este sueño dure cuanto menos para siempre. why maldigo cada segundo que no paso a tu lado. Cada instante en que quiero why no puedo. Es entonces cuando más te pienso. Es entonces cuando más te sueño. Es entonces cuando más te quiero. Busco a mi alrededor why no encuentro nada. No veo nada que no sea esta distancia. Nada que no seas tu why esta distancia.

Could never be erased; it lives inside of me.

Take me to that secret place,

And nothing else will ever feel this way.
You take away my guilty stains,

It's only by the Power of Your name.

Taken by the wonder of Your name.

Never needed it so much,
Cause all I want is You.

You've got to fortify my love to fortify me
You should be mine, anything you want
You've got to fortify my love to fortify me

Can you woo, woo, woo?
Should be mine all mine

Anyway, that your heart has been denied
You can come to me, every time that we're together
Just confirms the good thing we've got
And something this good can't be defined
One thing's for sure that you should be mine

Anything you want
You've got to fortify my love to fortify me
You should be mine, anything you want
You've got to fortify my love to fortify me

Can you woo, woo, woo?
Can you woo, woo, woo?
Can you woo, woo, woo?
Should be mine all mine

In the height of your worry
Where it's running too deep for you
When it all proves too much, too much, too much
I'll pull you through

I can't hold back what I know inside
It's just a fact that you should be mine

Anything you want
You've got to fortify my love to fortify me
You should be mine, anything you want
You've got to fortify my love to fortify me

Can you woo, woo, woo?
Can you woo, woo, woo?
Can you woo, woo, woo?
Should be mine all mine

You should be mine
You should be mine

I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances down to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythms go, go, go

I got a man with two left feet

I really think that he should know

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Hey boy, how you been?
I got a thousand lines, where do I begin?
And I, I been here, been there traveling
I saw you at the corner, my vibe kicked in

And two fields, I clock you
Wearing tight jeans and real nice suit
He was smiling like you was just seventeen
I asked him for a dance, he said yes please

Take a sip of dancing juice, everybody's onto you
Through the left and to the right
Everybody hit the rhythm it's on tonight

I'm gonna feel the beat within my soul
I need a man to take control
Let the melody blow you all away

Does he wash up? Never wash up

Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Work it out now, work it, work it out now
Do the mambo, shake it all around now
Everybody on the floor
Let me see you clap your hands

I wanna see you work
I wanna see you move your body and turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn
I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now

And then you don't
And then you say you will
And then you won't
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?
Now you want to play
And then it's no
And when you say you'll stay

That's when you go
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?
I've been sitting on a fence
And it doesn't make much sense
'Cause you keep me in suspense
And you know it
Then you promise to return
When you don't
I really burn
Well, I guess I'll never learn

And I show it
If you've got a heart
And if you're kind
Then don't keep us apart
Make up your mind
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall

Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me señorita

For you (ooh, she loves it when I come)
For you

Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for youI'm sorry to say that I didn't know her name
In fact the last six hours are a haze
Piecing together the fragments of a frame
Why my motor skills are out of phase
I feel like I've awoken in a maze
Though we've never met before
Baby, I am sure

Hm
1, 2, 
A 1, 2, 3, 4

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
One of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
It was one of those things

If we'd thought a bit about the end of it
As we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So good-bye and amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things
One of those things

If we'd thought a bit about the end of it
As we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So good-bye, good-bye and amen
Here's hopin' we'll meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those thingsOh, je voudais tant que tu te souviennes
Des jours heureux où nous étions amis
En ce temps-là la vie était plus belle
Et le soleil plus brûlant qu'aujourd'hui

Les feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle
Tu vois, je n'ai pas oublié
Les feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle
Les souvenirs et les regrets aussi

Et le vent du Nord les emporte
Dans la nuit froide de l'oubli
Tu vois, je n'ai pas oublié
La chanson que tu me chantais

C'est une chanson qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais, et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous les deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais, moi qui t'aimais

Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement, sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable
Les pas des amants désunis

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Tout doucement, sans faire de bruit

Les pas des amants désunisMother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yea

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see

What's going on
Ya, what's going on
Ah, what's going on

In the mean time
Right on, baby
Right on

Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Oh

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality

Tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's going on - Uh

It's all right when you're holdin' my hand 
It's all right when you say you love only me 
It's all right knowin' you understand 

It's all right when you whisper sweet words to me 
It's all right when I'm kissin' you 
It's all right just to know that you're mine 
It's all right to say that I'm in love with you 

Bridge: 
Little things don't matter anymore 
'Cause you know I love you, that's for sure 

It's all right just to know that my love is true

It's all right just to feel the way that I do 
It's all right to know that it's all right with you

(repeat verse 3, then repeat its last line) You sigh, the song begins, you speak and I hear violins
It's magic
The stars desert the skies and rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic
Without a golden wand or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand, the world becomes a wonderland
It's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows when there is no rain
It's magic
Why do I tell me myself these things that happen are all really true

When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you

You're as sweet as the flowers of springtime
You're as pure as the dew from the rose
I had rather be somebody's darlin'
Than a poor boy that nobody knows

Be nobody's darlin' but mine loveWell they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia,
Said: "Steve, you're way behind time,
"This is not 38, this is Ol' 97,
"Put her into Spencer on time."

Then he turned around and said to his black, greasy fireman,
"Shovel on a little more coal.
"And when we cross that White Oak mountain,
"Watch Ol' '97 roll."

And then a telegram come from Washington station,
This is how it read:
"Oh that brave engineer that run ol 97, 
"Is lyin in old Danville dead."

'Cos he was going down a grade making 90 miles an hour,
The whistle broke into a scream.
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle,
Scalded to death by the steam.

And then a telegram come from Washington station,
This is how it read:
"Oh that brave engineer that run ol 97, 
"Is lyin in old Danville dead."

Oh, now all you ladies you'd better take a warning,
From this time on and learn.
Never speak hard words to your true-lovin' husband.
He may leave you and never return.

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

O que é felicidade, o que é felicidadeSi tienes un hondo penar  
Piensa en mí­;  
Si tienes ganas de llorar  
Piensa en mí­  
Ya ves que venero

All of these flowers
For this friend of ours, it's such a shame
All of these people
All of them equally feel the same
There's silence and weeping
Looks like he's sleeping, the children say
They say he was ready, I hope he was ready
Is the prayer I'm praying

When Gabriel begins to blow
Victory shall be mine
When the horses get ready to go
Angels won't leave me behind

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be, got to be ready
When the chariot comes
(When the chariot, when the chariot comes)
I'm gonna be, got to be ready
When the chariot comes

(Giddyup)
Over the prairie
The pallbearers carry and lay him to rest
Satan's a cheater, Christ is the teacher
And life's the test

Oh Lord, take me higher
Never liked fire, I can't stay here
I gotta get ready, gotta get ready
Time has drawn near
When Gabriel begins to blow
Victory shall be mine
When the horses get ready to go
The angels won't leave me behind

[Chorus]

As I lay me down to sleep
I pray my soul you keep
If I die before I wake
I pray my soul you'll take
'Cause I gotta be, gotta be ready, when Jesus comes
When that chariot comes
Got to be , got to be ready, when the chariot comes

[Repeats]
Said I've got to be, got to be ready
When the chariot comesI took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And then I peeped through the crack
And I looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you(do do-do do do do-do)
(do do-do do do do-do)
The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm!
What do I care how much it may storm?
For I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember a worse December

Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.God, there is gold hidden deep in the ground
God, there's a hangman that wants to come around

How we rise when we're born
Like the ravens in the corn
On their wings, on our knees
Crawling careless from the sea

God give us love in the time that we have

God, there guns growing out of our bones
God, every road takes us farther from home

All these men that you made
How we wither in the shade
Of your trees, on your wings
We are carried to the sea

Maybe you ain't gettin' at home?
 
Your hair is in place
You're dressin' to kill
Your old man has promised
When he died he would leave you his money
And the pool where you swim
Are you lookin' for somethin'
Maybe you ain't gettin' from him?
 
Steppin' out, steppin' out
To get a little action on the side
Steppin' out, steppin' out
The day time queen takes a midnight ride

You're a woman who wants to get free
If you're steppin' out tonight, honey,
Come on and step out with me
 
The party's a bore
It's bound to get worse
Let's sneak out somewhere
And engage in our own celebration
Will you pour me some wine?
Are you thinkin', baby, maybe
Your needs are the same as mine?
 
Wanna go for a walk,
Go for a ride,
Maybe just stand here and think
What we can do to each other
No, we don't have to dance
If you're thinkin' of steppin' out
Baby, this is your chance
 
Steppin' out, steppin' out
To get a little action on the side
Steppin' out, steppin' out

And it's plain as plain can be
You're a woman who wants to get free
If you're steppin' out tonight, honey,
Come on and step out with me
Where is the ritual
And tell me where where is the taste
Where is the sacrifice
And tell me where where is the faith

Someday there'll be a cure for pain
That's the day I throw my drugs away
When they find a cure for pain
Where is the cave

Where the wise woman went
And tell me where
Where's all that money that I spent
I propose a toast to my self control

You see it crawling helpless on the floor
Someday there'll be a cure for pain
That's the day I throw my drugs away
When they find a cure for pain 

When they find a cure for pain 
When they find a cure find a cure for painBetter than watching Gellar 
Bending silver spoons 
Better than witnessing

She who sees from up 
High smiles and surely sings 
Perspective pries her once 
Weighty eyes and

Ni pagar tu amor amargo con la propia vida 
No fue suficiente abandonar mis sueños

Algo por mi 

No fue suficiente vivir

Aun así te vas

Es que tu único amor 
Era el tuyo por ti 

Cada vez que me mirabas a los ojos 
No buscabas otra cosa mas que tu reflejo 
Cada beso 
Cada vez q me tocabas 
Nada te importaba 
Solo tus sentidos 
Que no sienten nada, nada

No fue suficiente vivir

Don't mean to get in anybody's way.
The Gods seem willing: sun's in the sky.

Old crows cawing as the straight crows fly.
There was a time when love was the law.
There was a time for the tooth and the claw.
Last rites given, no holds barred.
Heaven Express on my credit card.

Now let me draw the jungle line 
I won't cross yours if you don't cross mine.
Won't make trouble, I don't need no fuss.
But I'm wounded, old and I'm treacherous.

Allow me to draw the jungle line 
You cross it once, you cross some friends of mine.
They won't make trouble, they don't need no fuss
But they're wounded, old and they're treacherous.

In the crisp of evening, on sacred ground 
Ghosts of fathers pushing moonbeams round.
Big cats prowling inside your head -
They left for China; better left for dead.

Let me draw the jungle line 
I won't cross yours if you don't cross mine.
Won't make trouble, I don't need no fuss.
But I'm wounded, old and I'm treacherous.

Living mountains going to shake that town 
Big mother calling you from underground.
She don't want trouble, she don't need no fuss.
But she's wounded, old and treacherous.Sunday morning 9 a.m.
I saw fire in the sky
I felt my heart pound in my chest
I heard an eagle cry

Now I´m alive I can breathe the air
Feel the wind, smell the earth in the air
I watch an eagle rise above the trees
Project myself into what he sees

[Chorus: ]
Hey
Take me away
Come on and fly me away
Take me up so high
Where eagles fly

I often dream I sail through the sky
I´ve always wished I could fly
The simple life of a bird on the wing
Oh Lord, I could sing

[Chorus: ]

Oh yeah
I´m alive, I breathe the air
Wash the earth from my face
I catch a glimpse of another dream
I turn, I look but there´s no trace

[Chorus: ]

Oh yeah
Eagles fly, oh, take me away
Eagles fly, oh, take me away
Come on, let´s fly away where eagles fly
Come on, fly away where eagles flySunday morning 9 a.m.

Through your weakest moments to leave them behind you 
Returning nightmares only shadows 

We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now 

Crosses all over, heavy on your shoulders 
The sirens inside you waiting to step forward 
Disturbing silence darkens your sight

We burn to book of lies
We feed our hate, eternal fate, soon He will arise
We gather in the night, to sacrifice ad feast
We shall call the dead, we shall hail the Beast

We possess the powers to slain the son of god
We possess the powers, to make him choke in blood
We're the infernal legion that gorge upon hellish lust
We chant the words of Satan,
We'll turn your god to dust

We open wide the gates, we unleash powers of Hell
We unlock the doors to where evil spirits dwell
We dance in rings of fire to bring eternal war
We'll rape the infant Jesus, molest that f*ckin' whore

We summon up, in blasphemy,
The true nocturnal lord
In His name we'll raise our swords,
And join His battlehorde
Our mission is to desecrate,
And forever chime death's bell
We have gained immortality through our cult in HellSalvame, salvame, salvame

Antes de decirme nada
Mirame bien a la cara
El sonido que me llama
Desde el fondo de la nada
Envenena el gozo de mi ser
Esto no es mas que un mal sueño
Del que quiero despertar.

Cada escena de mi vida
Es la lucha desmedida
Entre lo que he sido why lo que soy
No me digas que me calle
No me digas que me marche
Esto nunca fue la realidad
Why si sólo ha sido un sueño
Del que debo despertar.

Salvame, Dios mio salvame
Por eso salvame
Dios mio salvame.

Aunque trate de esconderme
Yo no se disimular
Todo el mundo me señala
Por ser fuente de maldad
Por eso salvame Dios mio salvame.

Ya no se como rogarte
Que me ayudes a encontrar
Un camino de retorno
Aunque tenga que penar
Por eso salvame, Dios mio salvame.

Salvame, Dios mio salvame

Elle chante et danse dans mon cur

Avec des mots naïfs et tendres
Elle raconte un grand amour
Mais il m'a bien semblé comprendre
Que la femme souffrait un jour
Si l'amant fut méchant pour elle
Je veux en ignorer la fin
Et pour que ma chanson soit belle
Je me content du refrain

Ils s'aimeront toute la vie
Pour bien s'aimer, ce n'est pas long
Que cette histoire est donc jolie
Qu'elle est donc belle, ma chanson

Metal Guru is it you, Metal Guru is it you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Metal Guru is it you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Metal Guru is it you, yeah, yeah, yeah ....I heard a rumor that love will make you crazy
Well is it true?
Well that's no rumor, look at the crazy things that love made Jesus do
The friends he chose were thought to be outrageous
And you could even find him touching the contagious
And the craziest is how he chose to save us
He gave his life away
Then he had to go and say
"Gotta love the same way that I love you!"

Love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
The way he loves you and me
Ã???Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy

What the world needs now is for love to spread
As fast as the rumors do
But to make it, we gotta take this thing from another whole point of view
We can start by keeping our vows, and not breakin' promises
And bring hope to the women at the well, and the doubting Thomases
And you kids, you gotta cheerfully do what your pops and your mama says
He gave his life away
Then he had to go and say
"Gotta love the same way that I love you!"

Love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
The way he loves you and me
'Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy

Well I'm tellin' you boy, you got a lot to learn
I think you're crazy all right to love for nothin' in return
You've lost your marbles, got a few loose screws
And if you count your cards I'll bet you got less than fifty-two
But now you got me thinkin', you sorta planted a seed
'Cause you know this might be just the kind of love that I need
Naw, your train's off the track, you're from the loony bin
You know that brain that you ordered? Well it never came in
Or else you've fallen on your head and all your brains leaked out
'Cause your lights are on, but ain't nobody in your house
Your elevator doesn't quite reach the top floor
I think you're out in left field, and I could say a lot more
But you don't care what I think, it doesn't matter what I'm tellin' you
You got the love of Jesus, and he's the one compellin' you to love
Like he does
You gotta love like he does
You gotta love like he does
'Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazyOh well I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are well, you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em 'cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em they don't even know my name
They call me the wanderer yeah the wanderer
I roam around around around

Oh well there's Flo on my left and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl with that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt I got Rosie on my chest
Cause I'm the wanderer yeah the wanderer 
I roam around around around

Oh well I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
'Til I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists of iron and I'm going nowhere

I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine and ride around the world
Yeah I'm the wanderer yeah the wanderer
I roam around around around

Oh yeah I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine and ride around the world
Yeah 'cause I'm a wanderer yeah a wanderer
I roam around around around
Cause I'm a wanderer yeah a wanderer
I roam around around aroundOh, you can kiss me on a Monday
A Monday, a Monday is very, very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would
Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best
But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest
 
Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest
But never, never on a Sunday[Instrumental]

Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing

Hey

I heard an echo but the answer had changed
From the word I remembered

Breathing is feeling, running, and freezing
We're getting dirty but I started out clean

Vamonos a andar el mundo antes que el mundo se acabe
El que muere andando el mundo asta la muerte le sabe
Cuando mi madre me tubo debajo de un husachito
Cuando la partera vino yo ya andaba borrachito

Pero jovencita de favor te pido
Que cuando me mescas me mescas
Seguido, seguido,seguido, seguido y seguido
Hasta que en tus brazos me quede dormido.

Ni modo oiga así nací callejero

En sonora ice un robito de allá me venían siguiendo
El robo venia llorando y yo me venia sonriendo
Cuando mi madre me tubo debajo de un husachito
Cuando la partera vino yo ya andaba borrachito

Pero jovencita de favor te pido
Que cuando me mescas me mescas
Seguido, seguido,seguido, seguido y seguido
Hasta que en tus brazos me quede dormido.Chilling in my four point six at the light 
Bout to be VIP for the night 
Shorty in the drop top V made a right 
Pull up to her bumper baby, beeped twice 
Jumped out the whip like I was the police 
Didn't have a gun, but my wrist said freeze 
Got Friday on a DVD 
She's a baller and I'm a baller 
What? 

[Chorus]
To all my hot girls 
Livin' fiesta 
To all my hot boys 
Livin' fiesta 
To all my Chi town niggas 
Fiesta 
And all my uptown niggas 
Fiesta 
To all my players and my hustlers 
Fiesta 
And if you sittin' on them blades 
Fiesta 
To all my honeys in the club 
Fiesta 
And if you rollin' with a thug 
Fiesta 

We be off in the club sippin lot 
Red eye deep in the club puffin' Lye 
Strippers in the back of the club showing live 
Soon as I get a buzz I'm showing out 
House on top of the hill 
Counting what? 
Whose gonna buy the bar? 
Got enough 
Take the haters out in the back, rough 'em up 
I'm a baller now where's my ballers? 
What? 

[Chorus]

We pop Cris on a daily base 
Plus we got honeys all up in the place 
Bout to wild out in a major way 
So put your hands up if you made your pay 
Add a little juice to the Tangaray 
But let the ice show till the diamond fades 
Rockland sittin' on Capitol Hill 
Trackmaster make capital deals 

[Gotti] 
Now look at Gotti iced out with the blingy-bling 
And a big body sittin' on them gleamy things 
Now Rockland niggas know the means of cream 
Kelly, R&B Thug and it sings to king 
Got PJ niggas in caprime green 
(Thugged out) 
Hot chicks down to do anything 
Cop them mo chicks 
Cop mo bricks, pop mo Cris 
Hey Kelly drop mo hits 

[Boo] 
What you know about them cats 
That be spendin' the dough 
Every day drink Henney and a bottle of Mo' 
Ride whips, hittin' chicks 
Blowin' twenties on drough 
To the club thirty deep 
Plenty of ice to show 
Mami say she never rolled in a six before 
(Fiesta) 
Never seen a young cat this rich before 
Yeah Kelly made the way for these niggas to blow 
Thugged out, 2G, Rockland for sure 

[Chorus]
