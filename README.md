# Song-Lyric-Scraper
This python application scrapes lyrics from Lyrics.com and analyses it in different ways
# What I learnt
I learnt how to use the libaries BeautifulSoup, requests and Counter. By first getting the html of lyrics.com/random.php using 
requests and then scraping the lyrics using BeautifulSoup I can then analyse the data. For this program i just analysed the freqency of letters, words and lines using Counter.
